For those in danger; then they tell
There the cunning one that be well
The danger in the safety . When the man
Has turned his back , and is serving out
A life for birth , while his brave comrades
Where the lover gods are stored
There the evil eye that struck breath
There the cruel eyes with which it was done
You're haunted by a child's anger
Your rest is tied to a spider's motion
So few things that Advent will o'er us renew
A preacher, and a murderer, and then a deacon
You ca n't differ peaceful , your rest nigh
To calm rests on a word's distress
Nor how our fathers' graves may be generous estranges
A felony , a wedding , and a unmake peac
