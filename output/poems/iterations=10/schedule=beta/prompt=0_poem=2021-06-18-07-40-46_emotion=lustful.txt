The heart, till now a solitary thing
Of light involvement only, she moved all night
Until she dwelt with her so passionate and strong
Defiled , defiled , her sighted and naked heart
In their first hate awefully front to front
Seeking some neutral zone between joy and doom
The child that with its pirate peers go up
Bound up with night's and twilight's drear shadows
With ashes laden, will dew my grave. Not there
But in the sunshine of God's trust, of him
Who twilles me, all sin's transgression seems
And I , who merited most , differ merg 'd above
But 'e was so kind 'e let me go
To brook after is wife, ma'am
Aye 'twas better far for me, ma'am
To hae me 'arf she√®m a civilian , ma'a
