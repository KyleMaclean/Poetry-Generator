Did such only for their sake, who teach
The idle, pleased, to live disjointed,
And selfishly give themselves the care ,
And same people none ?
Chisel your silhouette o'er the creeping ivy
With clean, even, hand, each line let down
Paint not so boldly, Berlin, pinks and roses
Spite of your long experiment (I like your experiment
Can keep quiet to starve so much solace
And on the camel
Gross with beauty and youth
I 've seen the seven Hell
Dost love the master of the wife
Who feels her soul in every fibre
Dost love the man who parted you
When life felt very thorn
