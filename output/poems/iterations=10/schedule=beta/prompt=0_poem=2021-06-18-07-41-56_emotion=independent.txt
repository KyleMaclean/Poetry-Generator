Evermore they were on guard,
Hemming the strong hands of the
Till one by one they turn in in the
Warding the houses from gradual raiders ;
And all the unwind has been blown through me
And all the sunbeams, free

When thou didst boil the water for my pancure
In the Broom! thou saidst, and smiled, and answered
If the city ever flamed but you
The hedges green and the rughs askew
The great white barn with its quarrying
And feathery sheds , where herds make flock and fee
