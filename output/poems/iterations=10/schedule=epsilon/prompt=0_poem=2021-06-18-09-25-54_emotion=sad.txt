Long dreary dreary,
Long dreery dreery,
tall dreest to a treble of treble,
I 'm non so
But I 'll backwards the same effect
If I 'm stock subroutine up to sonorous out I 'm undefeated
It would elate my moody mode
And the sorrowful bastard of the scotch
And the minimum costalgia of the age of year
Of their kings, we kneel and grieved
And we laugh, O, very Weble Werez
The mind also grange and dark
And crazy forget ruin convexness to ruin
Our trounce was not black to see
The maddest ruining almost maneuve
