For those in danger; then they tell
The danger in the danger. When the man
Has turned his back, and is serving out
A life for death, while his brave comrades
That fat hell within the heart should take no part
And every thing , dying apart and weeping apart
we will be lying in our sick bags
She has linked to sin the most sin could
Their sleep was bitter as their death more
But one turned up dead and another
But the worst is o'er and done
His violent pace to her loose cope and shoe
We disdain, 'twas said, to take in hate
He that has fought with devils for one day
But mind, there's one: you must die alone
Much Life, much Death; both leave and new Collaps
