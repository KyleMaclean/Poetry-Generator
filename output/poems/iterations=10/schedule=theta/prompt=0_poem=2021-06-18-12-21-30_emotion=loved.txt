Because they would never agree I had to
Till I was entrusted with
a colossal understatement
as to come along ignorant .
Vulgar errors, given to you by the Law
To draw all eyes that would fail to see
And the worst of it bursts upon us now
This monster, killed by water.... This is the same
And the real devil knows how I 'm of all time to rue
And you shall taste, and deliver souls from hell
This near deity I will brand so cruel
The lowest point on earth to avenge an insult
Beneath your rocky bottoms Treble would kill
Which men call livid that have lost their light
He knows, but has no heed or faintest fool
For who can talk of kings and rulers dea
