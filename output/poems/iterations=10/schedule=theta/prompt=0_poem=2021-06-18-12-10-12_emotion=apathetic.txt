The lazy western sun
from a long fast,
choses some straw to his
scatters fig and taro
May non desire too for
The bairn o ' poor Warkside hae drawn mine eye
on the terrace , the dwarf sequoers the day
The dead were there so heap√©d and so black
That I , an American language , have helped to kill
Life, but Death, and I have lived, and known
And the horse, and the devil in the dirk
Bigger then than any big enough to friggin' murder
But since I've come across the Devil we've met
To all but one heart in her terrors clad
And lead them out where he might be killed
Had any bitch or bastard threatned actually or rumore
