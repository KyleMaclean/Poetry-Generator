One day he entered a room
He thought was an ordinary-sized room,
And , jump , found he was inside
The young female of the family .
He flossed it, he cross edgewise the hard way
with lenses . And how many blocks ? Too to
The loon, the owlet, and the chaff cried over
Thou hast defaced, and i' the wine-yard bad away
We laid it in their laps alongside the Dead
led them to R.K. as their guide to death
Aarrrg! The world's going to hell in a handbasket
But of this plight Apollo, in awe and fear
So the white devils pass us, as we pass
And he's dead now, so we don't know
Stood by thee slaying:  thou still art killing
May be broken by the terrors of Christ's wil
