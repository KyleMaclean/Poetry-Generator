For those in danger ; then they differentiate
The immediate danger in the danger . When the stronger man
stimulate sour his second , and is serve out
A lifespan for last , while his brave comrades
Where the lover god are stored
There the evil center that scratch breath
There the ingenious enough one that injure
There the cruel eyes with which it was done
You ca n't personify passive , your perch nigh
To calm relaxation on a word 's distress
You 're haunted by a anxious child 's anger
Your rest is tied to a spider's motion
Nor how our fathers' graves may be generous estranges
So many things that Advent will o'er us renew
A near-blind preacher , and a murderer , and then a deacon
A felony , a wed , and a warfar
