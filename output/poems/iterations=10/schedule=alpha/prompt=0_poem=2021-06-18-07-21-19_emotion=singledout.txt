O, that I were no more!, which phrase
She hath absolutely self-governing in her inexplicable slew
* scoop to sis but support by law
Nell she tip down the porch
With bend brain , and very twisted
She knelt to harebrained at her heave
Nell she shiver'd worse than thin
At the tidings of the Lord the tiger tolerate
With his steel slant across the spider
And the spider, slithering to poison, is dead
Poisoned with the tinder of the Lord
A species to live with in the golden game
That killing one will only lead to more killings
