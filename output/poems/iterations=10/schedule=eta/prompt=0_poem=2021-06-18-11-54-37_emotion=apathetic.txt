The lazy western sun
from a laborious leash ,
satirize some salmi to his
scatters fig and taro
May not desire too much for her at all
The bairns o' poor Warkside hae drawn mine eye
on the t , the tactician tac ties the tact
The dead were there so heap√©d and so unprovoked
That I, an American, have helped to kill
Life, but Death, and I have lived, and known
And the w , and the devil in the dirk
Bigger then than any big enough to friggin' murder
But since I've come across the Devil we've met
To all but one heart in her terrors clad
And keep them out where he might ken calmed
Had any ra or rex rebutted recently or relishe
