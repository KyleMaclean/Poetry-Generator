Evermore they were on guard,
sacking the scholastic scissors of the
Warding the houses from sudden raiders ;
Till one by one they fell in the
New hopes perspile, new schemes seek row from old
That one made the other his aide and joy
wantonly the washable watchword of waterman 's waitress in itself
Love caesar for his salmons to save the saunders
And think the greatest things are those we ate
I'd take the first or last, love, of all
But to one 's self one is n't so mad
Who, on his freedom in this realm to live
Home to thee, to my love, to see thee
And satirize the safe salinity to say the best
But galvanize , Lord , get to me this garble
Aye come we the best and cal of bedel
