What we have done,
And what we should do.
Then and there
The case is closed.

The Dauphin's at the Seine,
Dead against the rocks.
That of Brennus failed,
Made us take note.
Pellucid or unfaulted,
Stream or predew or prenium,
That of Petrarch we learned--
That writers' matters are telltale
And can be learned of posterity.
How the minutia of verse
Makes obsolete the long behind it,
In a passion of months and a fever of times--
Some Decca Snell,
Some Cilceta,
Some Bernardino,
Wasps for the Crestana,
Sowutha butterfly, poet-knott.
The miniscus of a pale Wensday
Came to a cinder down.
Chaucer's dang and he's a credit lazy,
He knows as much as can be learned of him,
And Pitman knows more.
Long may they be!--Red Gillycomb's a fighter
Shall turn him out of his quivering marrow,
Sundering him with Ciceronian expostulations--
And the Deacon of Decca sings him along.
I should take to drinking my daemonic health
As the Hanmer, the Whitman, the Painless King
Was a soporific to peace, to the Year of the Horse,
As now the Decca drinks me into stupor,
Out, out all yon terrors of the laws,
Let me only this night dined with the Deacon,
Out, out! my roundelay--to those tidings of the stars!
That is the song of the literary vesper;
Now draw your boats up to the shore!

Here comes my lady, the morning's mirth and she's like to make
Friends of every writer-mistake and every writer-humor,
Right, like, I s'pose, as the wind? Well sigil's a humor-tale,
Right, like, that the wretch, whose vices you fancy a hero,
Should nohow be a fool? Or that he's a hero--right, like the wind?
Hail to the ladies, then, who in their spears are shorn
From their heads, for their right of speech, because they're fools!
You'll learn, you will not authorise this quip of Saul.
To the bard be glad all time this morn!
Grass is grass, is the best grass, but the hardest is probably his;
To the bard let beauty and mortal happiness combine,
Bards are grass, is the best grass, but the hardest to find,
And as for doom of women--why, the ancients often go

Here is not death to them, as they've unfortunately not yet come out and formed their little tomb.

Good-bye, bad music! long have I lived that I must say good-bye to you!
Here comes good music, but it is not pleasing, for I can't do your work with him.
Grass is beautiful, is grass, but the best, if not made by a poet, is made by no one;
Chirping, caws, and squaws are pretty creatures, and do not last long on the sand,

For see, he's author! that master of all airs and daffodils!
He may have brought you this quiet,
That has kill'd the ferns I nursed in my garden,
That has made the snail-ice at last a knoll,
And the grass-skirt thus at Venulus died on--
But he's author! and he's no more--such an one's also no more!

Here she lies dead Straw-that's my niece!--dear aunt,
He that hath her private villa'd here in her stead
Caught by the bullet of a poor farmer,
Him that took time's flesh in his little pocket-knife,
Heal'd his brethren, fight'd the plebeian, break'd his legs--
I wish I was still the cleaner!  Don't talk so deep.
If you wish to know my reasons for bringing this,
If you wish to be glad that such a visitor died,
Then babble more!  This you, bad man,
That this bade the while, 'tis vain to require,
This can't but do, by jingo, as you can't make the same
Application to literature, that you make to every other branch of

Where she sleeps, by grass and ferns uncased,
Near, dear dead one! even as thou lovest her,

To hang from me--
And it will soon be ducked,
And taken by some one else;
The gazer is baulked by the blind,
And never shall he get at it.

I speak of trifles,
And trifles is all my book;
As if it boiled and bubbled in a tin can.
It will not boil this month, nor ever.
Nor yet will it boil, if I should pot it.
What are you?--God's furling hands?
I would thou wert, to boil, not I.
Take me to Heaven, to take thy grace,
Though he can walk the waters,
And drive a skiff, and sink him in the bottom;
And I to fling, the topsails, not to float.
And never, I think,
That thou, to ease my toil,
Shalt coals of me,
Make demands upon me, or coins to charge;
But leave the funds, - their accruing hoard,
To melt with fires, for whatsoe'er they call
The Master, when he 'reflects' me.
Thus I can tell,
And thus thy let me know,
And bid thee look to me,
For with the lamp I mean to shine,
Though long he touts with gab to play his tricks,
And spread his cloudy fins at me,
And with his buffets try me;
So, til I be more or less away from him,
Then to my abode, to ride a storm-bird,
And the tempest face, as if it had begun,
To pose, to leap, have clapaped me,
And, to have cleared the Dirce of my search,
And sat rolled in carcase at my side,

When of late, 'mid the frigid wintry air,
So chill and silent appeared,
What time in graves the winter pall descends,
In tombs of frost, on mountain snow,
The Shadow-God of Twilight there did pass,
In utmost life expiring time;
To every crevice in the subterranean glen,
Where nought but whisper could wean them thence,
Where murmuring waters did not glitter,
Shadowy glens, where ev'ry floweret failed;
All this region, never glittered,
Where lay only Thence, Thence, the shadow.

Where shadow-soft the dreams of solemn green,
Caught from the twisted o' the moon were hid;
Where shadows from the pink dawn were always flown,
'Mong oaks, in orange glens, alakes so high;
Where crystal dews would twinkle awake,
Up in the lindens of the land,
Was shadow, all, but shadow, very swift,
Where ev'n then did shineth vision;
And e'en to where the heart would break it,
The loud world's reprimand did grate.

Twixt gravely laid in cold earth,
And bricked up fast with mighty stone,
The moral lesson was:--"Try your best,
But never fear to speak or hear;
To every secret joy of sight,
Still be in polite speech assur'd;
To ev'ry accoutrip heed;
And, whenever you can, still say,
'We see nothing new; let us see;
Might it be a cove? it would be
 A cloister cool, a supper sweet;
Let us mark, whilst the sly wind does breathe,
Creamy puddoun, prest on a brown;
New curds, from goats, or from kings, I demand;
Carrow-berries, or currant, or dates;
Rut-oat slices, or 1lb. of butter;
Venus, with thy own hand thou eas'!
Let me, good friends, my form display,
In all the familiar shows;
On Sundays, at prebends and prayers,
Sha'n eat in the Queen's Chamber;
Shall cake a brolly, or two,
For thy new-made parish;
And, in March, a twenty mile ride,
Shall take my house in Thurston town:
But now, with integrity,
With the benefit of my skill,
I'll run through two pounds in it,
And, to make it add unto two,
My maiden aunt, a picture, bring;
Which long my life, and this sorry funk,
Have kept from view, by the law--
Go, Adrian, till it be A goodly sight,
In Thurston-town, and then bring back more;
Now, that I've got it once more in view,

A brick, inlaid with cunning art,
There's magic in its veins.

So went a new year's day,
All the way over Paunch Street,
Cyclest, Cyclops, and, of course,
Jumping in a wheel at a time
By way of Eleousin
Rode the gaunt Cyclops, of course!

Bourn, a rook, was keeping watch,
Clinging, like the hands of a clock,
In and out, far as the eye could dart,
Over bagpipe and sword-hurl battle;
Here and there, peeping, it seemed to me,
Till the cocks began to crow.

Then out from Baghent's Woods appeared
Knight and man. Their drums were shaking,
As they pounded on their wings, and they beat
Thestars out like white-winged butterflies.
And lo, Paddy put his pocketchain
On backwards, and off he ran
With clashing drum and strict drum!

And all around the Pub!
And up from the Forest flowed free,
Flowers like the grass they gathered;
And all around the Pub!
All the lads came flocking,
As the noise of the parricorn passed,

'Twas a maiden in beauty
Who dwelt in the Forest, fawn-eyed,
Till she cruelly deceived;
And she fled in the morning,
But she could not remove
The watch from the Brook
Who kept false; and lo, Brough amuse
All the plain.

Till, in its defense,
She took her fledion,
Great Arj or Anonymous,
Whose neibor hirased
It from the winged stell.
Then out from the Forest, flocking,
Broke the Contract on plox,
And riders and risers,
Four, and six, and eight,
And ten, and twelve,
Trooped on a note of glee.

In the Cloak! Tingle-wog
Leaped in the Cloak!
Tingle-wog, with hairy ears,
Who can dodge this tingle-wog?
On a human landscape
Stoops the wog and leans.
Who can give in glee,
Lest he face the Cher.

And with main vessels and poolings
Broke the 9th,
To see the full glasses,
And full plates set down;
When a thundering wog,

Whirling like a chomper
On the parom,
To the cheers of the frater
And the shout of the frattere,
In the tall thin man,
With combed purse;

Down in the pit fell a wog,
On his knees down,
And many a plank
O' windows, and post,
And posts around,
And window-chairs,
Left lie for days,
For weeks, and the cold crisp
Pools of blood.

When the storm is up
The Gipsy Men lie low,
They are ranne 'neath the moon:
And they whisper, in their sleep,
They whisper to their neighbors,
They whisper to the Me.

And all night long, under the stars,
The Gipsy Men dream of home,
They dream of a furloughedril Loll,
Of a home eternally
Of all necessary free
Of all legals enforcements
Of the Greater Christ,
And of the agonies
Of their half-browned chain
Which he shall mould,
Under the soft full eye
Of a tall thin woman, who reads
Their sleep-writ; sees them yet,
Forever and for ever
In the dream-haunted dark,
And whispers to them still: to remain
Under the door,
Honest and hard.

As Grimm puts in his copy, word by word,
A slovenly number in his verse,
The ill-taught, grind-to-grasp of a waif
Of nonsense, trivia vulgar,
So to every truth you strain,
Sparce vive! So to every secret plot
Of ragged stupidness takes force
And strikes it thro for bliss
Obscuring the eyes of the world
With obscenity of minds.

The Gipsy Men, for their thoughts are myriad,
They have so many that without care
Their sordid little bosoms fill to the brim
And their little breasts are piously filled
With the parotlec and the pecked plum
Of the fulgent palms, which is the fashion
Of their small, long pinched hands,
While their little, broad hats have more life

"Say it upon the someones they say it isn't all right", by John Holt [Love, Break-ups & Vexed Love, Realistic & Complicated, Relationships, Social Commentaries, Men & Women]
I dreamed last night she was agreable and--you?

Holly.

--How could you not be?
When the two of us wore that cow with the bell on it

You said the words the night wore quiet and I--well,

I dreamt we parted that way.
And I said the words and you said the most excellent

Actresses and you wore a bathtub, but--well,

I dreamt you loved me.
That's the way it stood the night we went away

(staring at the iced coffee)
or we spoke from the dawn of the morning till now:
that you were agreable and the worst was in the past

We are fighting instant deaths.
You say it but you're wrong.
You say you never wish I was away from you

Like the yoke bandaged and pulled,
The Professor's cup and the cud of the unfit surmise

Of the profligate & perf,
I sneaked from the hall drawer & lay warm upon my bed
--As you slept?
I was you sleep?
I was you sleep?
You were you sleep?

Tell me how you watch the distant taunting team of rain
That heckles the ill tempest that darkens the hill
& you know and you know you do not care &
You have known it and yet . . .  Bear with me: gentle journals
I make of my common week-days & Saturdays
Are mine, & not yours.
I study what I eat & strive to forget the glories
I find.
There is thawing of the rocks & light breaking across bad nights

That light that breaks & thaws & breaks

Unmoving & all for me.
And there is only the number of the hours when the sun

The sun & what he wants.

"The Virgin", by T. S. Eliot [Living, Coming of Age, Parenthood, Time & Brevity, Relationships, Family & Ancestors, Social Commentaries, Popular Culture]
Sunday: his friend's 1-year-old daughter;
Sunday: me inside the wobbling-birth-machine
At The Village, thinking of love, & thinking of love
As coming long after I had come upon her
As approaching near
As any briefest dream can meet me.
The woman
Is self-moved and self-programmed
In this kind of thinking & believing.
I saw her last night
 & she was crying
But not as many times as once
As once I saw her as I tried to walk
The last stretch between two dropping stones
On some even moonless moonlit stone-bridge
Before I saw her again.
She took me once in each place
That seems to be heart-beating to me
Before I see her.
She lies near the machine
Where boys & girls are
As soon as they want to.
She lies near the blood-pressure measure
That murmurs in the chest till it finds the bed
Of its long-armed life-strings.
She lies near the pills that lie
SPONSORED in the breakfast bowl
When the morning is in my veins
Or on my lips at breakfast
In orange juice that is thick
As sweet sacred water.
I have scarcely any time to get and give
Since she has such each remov'd time
As all the days so far gone.
Her small feet press all night
The breathing-plate which is still and moist.
Her fingers all night
The veil of soft black cloth that is the self.
Her morning or day time cries
Are heard in the walls or in the house
That is ill, & where I am ill.
And where the rafters meet I know
Her dark-sized couch elsewhere plays.
She touches me all night, all day.
Her crying face in my blood
At dawn-time or in the evening use
Or evil sight.
Her tears, their histories,
Their origins, tears, are for nothing held sacred
As day-born hands perhaps, unknown
To anything sacred, may reach
At any time or anywhere
Though all tears have meaning.
Her crying & singing contain all things
Her tears are mothers, tears fall
Airless & unbreathed as tears
That have wet lips such as these.
Her singing body is

"The Family Jewels", by Stanley Moss [Living, Marriage & Companionship, Relationships, Men & Women, Judaism, Home Life, Men & Women, Pets, Arts & Sciences, Music, Social Commentaries, History & Politics, Popular Culture]
The children who have grown up in Jewish homes
have no memory of an old life. They see, in their ways,

a world transformed. To them, the past is forlorn

more hopeless than hopeless. Their own lives
honor and interest, the future beautiful, the future

of one's children one's own children. One learns
to love the boughs of one's own tree, the sky.
The reference in the voice of the children to R.K.

ABB'S tree is to R.K.'s one's birches, and ABB'S the bear of the grove,

the bear the children ask about, the one they saw at the end of their day's walk,

the one whose trunk they found a dove in,
the one whose voice, with love unbent,
led them to R.K. as their guide to death.
And the children ask for grownups' voices,

for sadness in the wonder more than potential in

the wonder that flies above

their flying after.

"Eden", by Stanley Moss [Living, Life Choices, Religion, God & the Divine]
The facts of history must be leaving

them forever—those seven pairs of adult

comrades who hid in Palestine,

30 years after the fact,
the unknown villages they lived in,

the lost villages they visited,

their trees crowding to keep them company

as the earth let them drop under or

cease to exist, the towns they

return to after adversity.
No visible signs, no border or window,

the Israelites wandering in the desert:

the barefoot argosies, the laborers

who move like moving sandstone,

a stone that will not be moved, the

flock the stone will not be storming.
The barefoot Moses, more than their father

showing calluses, lead them on.
And each, as GOD SAVES US, sends

a glacier of glass through the soil
and out again, as the ROCKY Pharaoh sends

us on a journey from the rock of RABBI JAMES,

to the reflective glass of JAMES, as PASABONET

makes a OCTOPRICE of her own Images:

the day the robot Carolyn (swathed in robot rags)

regales us with her PHYSICS, her EASY METER,

her instantaneous heart, the pill that takes the place

of water in the desert, love's vehicle.
As the mercuried POETOMAN defends her RIBBONS,

her RIDE (bereft in LAO) new, her bad heart's new

and DR. GABRIEL escorts them, as the NEON FORAS,

the NEON PHARO, the NEON REBORN eternal guests

of the glass room, where the NUMERAKS play

one side of a flimsy card in which he has

a grip that is alligator-like and weak

enough to bear in mind of the heart

that rolls for INDIA, for GRAVITA and

whose candle turns on the candles of the Bible.

"Kinship", by Stanley Moss [Living, Death, Relationships, Family & Ancestors, Religion, Judaism]
The noose, like a prayer star, sloped over,

a lantern lit on the lake with room for more.

I was about to say something supplicate when

it was my turn to say what I knew about the sea's

cold generosity, the generous heart of the marbles

that leads it upward, all the wind and salt of bereavement.

It was no moon in the moonless night, no starry night,

but a simple wind that lifts a gust from the sea.

The ripple on the corn, the crash of the downfall.

It is a thing to have been made in the Father's image

and it is a thing to be lost in the Father's
======================================== SAMPLE 6 ========================================
That soft whisper of breath to win.

And what a blast of wind!  If I should die,
How kind the call!  What joy to hear,
To stand and weep on the soft ground,
And greet the tidings with a smile.
That cry of fire!  The flames sprang out
From out the eyes of the broken-down house;
And then I thought what man was for a house
To no profit but in fire.

I said, "This little house that stands
To save me on the path that I must take,
Is not a house but some bleak monster born
To wreck and ruin in the air."
And lo!  I saw, and I began to forget
What went on before my mind,
And what I may be in time or guess;
For surely on that mammoth frame
Were visions of wealth, cover, Code,
More than could be found of value.

I thought it pleasant that the lord
Was further out, it made a change.
What in the world was waiting me,
I had not reckoned upon
That I was wanting to escape,
Or that there was nothing left to know.

Then I got out as if they'd forged
Some blazing iron and they did
A mountain-wise spiral lift the dust.
The scent and taste of earth and wood
Were gone; and the air was blown
With puffs from the MEZZOWS, small,
And COLD, and GARBLE, and everything
But house and lovers and little face,
By time-bleached wood and soil,
And that on which they'd predicted
To see their beautiful statues
As in pigs could they be seen
To have been built by muscles.

They urged me, it seemed that they
Would not let me be the slave
Of fools and creeds, as I might frame
From nothing anything that comes,
And with a joy in my thoughts to rend
That heaven the immortal gods
May have bestowed on me,
Blemished, unloved, as the light
Of dust that was their love had been.

They had said, "They who say that He
Perform the ordinary,
Pass the wide world's distractions,
Who is there equivalent
For the simple ecstasy which makes
One conscious that one was and that one is
That the sun in glory and front is
To measure with delight."

"Deign, O Luxembourg!  Are not we one,
Together from this their dangerous sin
Which vouchsafe no one eyes to take!
Since both have come so far and made
Their bow to love and taught us this,
That we should still go forward
And teach as we go."

It was a bright and friendly time; and the song
Of bounding children was the only music then,
Together joyous, both disporting in the play
Of that agreeable playtime, when the world
Surges like a brook in the blades of an apple-tree
That get split in the vigorous falling, rustling ere long.
I remember the gate of all my lonely years
Much more cheerful at the corner of the door
Than as I was used to it in the _crotte_ de Nancy's eyes.
(If I remember his wife's name aright.)

But as we passed on, seeing things to recognise'd
Through the evening's unsenceable eyes, I felt pursu'd
And spyre'd the stronger surprise of another's look;
And my fancy him still stranger and yet stranger inspects,
A subject he finds himself lost too soon to learn;
Our pass ''twas through the blue from which he took dyes
To score a digression, which were not all useless here.

O say not of it less that he was with Him
On earth, they two together, and none the less
The higher than did the nobler angel come
Upon him?  O Messie or Messid, whose voice
And look were most benign to all evil?  Where,
When pressed, was the repentance pure and choice,
Which aceval presence of humble things did bring?
They both did mark me.  The crown's great store of stars
Scattered through the mount's wonderfully array'd
Scintill'd, and put off straightway to the departed;
And the halo's text sternly discommended.

The world's gayer days he hath o'er overflowed,
And gone, that legacy, from his access,
But I am sorer than of old, of him,
Left desolate and in exile:_I_am dust's keeper now!
Thrown in with the rubbish of ungodly days!

I want to walk in that dust,
as the casked sound gives way to noise,
as the stones tumble from the road
over which the boy marches forth.
Over the vane,
the foot straps stay the same,

as I walk over the scarred road
where the boy has already gone.

It is not what is seen that is crucial,
but the spirit that animates each song,

and not in sufficient strength to abide

"On thinking of the child who is dead", by Soraya D'Entremell ☊ [Living, Infancy, Death, Sorrow & Grieving, Activities, Travels & Journeys, Religion, Christianity, The Spiritual]
How beautiful was his heart, his bewnosing

nostalgic for the green cornfield and
for summer, his pensive thirst

ignored the tallhen, the monks, their parchterness, the fasting
of the night over and over his Altdorfer,

a cantina seller, a peddler of chisels,
his brain navel on the shoulder of the sofaall night genuflecting in Aztec priestessens,
a pilgrim of that beginning and that end,

which are the same, travel is the Parchami's way.

"On remembering a dream in which a child's heart was consumed", by Soraya D'Entremell ☊ [Living, Birth & Birthdays, Philosophy]
The feeling of poison in the small of the back, the fingertips still,

the hair still lightly caressed, the pluck still in the air, the pads

still isolated and analyzed, the browZadores and Pequita, the Inf bar, the C,

the BRD León still in office, the phrase Y nada, the lifetime

only a number between innumerable and Yanquinares,

the front door still closed, the windows pulled

apart, the frontage still growing higher, growing

higher, the vacant backhole of the Garage still empty.

"Agitation", by Raffaello Fialabsigan [Living, Youth, Activities, Sports & Outdoor Activities]
I ran the wall jump in one quadricepinto the other, it wasgiant jug faces and angles crashingfor no reason, it hurt and I dropped
them, then myselfinto the wall mad, mad, I wasaround, then around, thenmy mind was around. The spectatorful audience stoodwith their ovals and potholes

no closer than arm's length: that wasthe extent of it.

Then I started the counter impulse, firstphucking to plan B, phitching from plan A, thisis the hour, this is the time,

the slick of my forearm, my arm silenced, silenced the earplugs retained,

the synchronized face of both the world and my body.

======================================== SAMPLE 9 ========================================
Ript in the sweet subtle splendours of the evening
I sat, and all my moods--all my moods--
All my passion--all my sorrow,--
Like some strong southern night,
With a taper's faint effulgence
Uplifted high
Above the dome
Of my unruffled hood:

All of me--my scorn, my scorn--
Till the bubbling nights
Turn me to some grim and dread
Mount this cold heart underground
And pierce my beholders
With the stern pale light
Of the dawn they cannot raise.

Weep not that thou shalt lose:
This be true love's vow:
What cause of word
Be to disparage?
So certainly is
Its power to grieve.

Weep not thou that thou shalt lose:
Here bewail
Its non-blooming title.
What mien of happy
Can hinder lastingly
The sweet loss of loss?
Lest there should ever be
A parting gifter.

"By this white flounce mumbly,
And by our brent speed
To Japan, O beware!"
"Come quickly to the Western sea,
And in near death be rescued
By O, cruel Japantia!"

"Once, coming to the surface
By me difficult,
As we were swinging,
Now I have risen up to speed thee
Up to see thee face to face
Up to the level with me!"

He rose, and a grave voice made answer
From a sea-corner listened,
"Leontia, listen!"--
"Allusion made--name withheld,
Risk not to place thyself,
Not of my luckless passing,
Needs not thy prayers."

"Love, help thou my boisterous would,
By thy ready guile.
I am like to fall woe-pointed
In thy arrows' feathers,
When my rage drives howling
On my wild goose flight!"

"Of things that in thy breast move,
Thy life be held by love;
If thou hate me, hate me not
With thy good shield;
Since 'twas thou that were our guide,
And pedestal right,"

She turned--a bright sword leapt
From her hand to strike herself unable,
The twang of gears within her that told her so
Tell her how the thing was done, her image in 't in 't,
Saying yet, "This only keep,
Thy belly on flame!

Oh, how there be flowers, things that aren't,
And things that seem to be flowers!
Some of them are things that scholars declare,
Some of them but to serve for love are deemed.
- The green to please thy belly, and the bloom to wear.

"I will do all of the 'flower' that I see,"
I said; "I won't know not till I have come,
And then I'll tell thee who has bought the ride."
"Take thou no fancy-dress; this sword is perfect,
And 'tis my heart thou'lt have another's end."

The stallion stood clear; his happy eyes
 Asked if he had done well or ill;
"To do all things well," he said; "and weep all manly.
"No further words, and take my pleasure now!"

So went he home; but home he set
Before his children, there the gold-hauler's state
In armor was received and given;
And home he had, and with his family

And the new-built turrets at the door being opened,
Nought of him learned; though for years to come

It is their labor and their joy they have,
It is their lovin', love, and take no mirth,
But watch the world, and are alive to it;
And he would say, his winter hand with butter
Should till the backs of stone, and brick's death
Be frowned at, and sooth'd, and suited with rain.

So soon they laid him down, and dressed his wound,
While the rain beat, and flew the marmot's wings
And driven home his wind, and soothed his fall.
Then, down the well-headed wold, and near the cliff
Borealtilled by sea and tempest, they a half mile
Came, and set up a grave and sweet abbace.

And there they bare aside, and to that place were coming
A hundred stones, his comrades who should bear him to that ground.
So to his end of life he would sit at need;
Held loose the strings of life, and pluck'd the reins of death;
So many

Early to rest thee, night of darkness,
The abysmal darkness of grief,
Abysmal darkness,
Of deepest darkness,
On whom
In a flame
Of splendor,
Of brightness,

O love, O life,
And these last gleams of sight.
Before thy eyes,
Of love,
Of beauty,
Of life,
Of moments which the shadow
Of the unknown wait,
And shall be, in thy days,
When thou hast left the earth,
For whom
The thunder is, and the hurricane,
The heavens are closed against thee,
The winds are at their wildest,
The waters prevail;
With thy divine faith,
With thy heart which is almost human,
An honest man in thee;
When these are lost, then thou art
No longer man, but an offshoot
Of the cross, and that is more than man.

Flower of the almond-bearing earth,
At whom dost find nought welcome?
Who can say, yet, who can say,
Should he see future life?
To whom should tune in mind and song,
The evening star?
To the evening star, or to thee,
To what may befall
Thy future life;
But to thee, and only to thee,

Wander we and watch with vain things,
The day's short day;
And boastful wander we
As trees that lack day;
And show on earth, as things of joy,
Much wanting,
And glorious things.
The simple is the wise,
The brave the good,
The beautiful to see, and strange,
The touched strange underhand;
The spirit under-ground
Goes sorely wrong.

The busy dead have lost their abode,
Under the dark botteau;
The little trolls have taken it by force,
And the graceless mountebanks their terrors;
The old mans Henchmen, now no more at home,
Have no more been wooers of the dead:
Grave-looking times, that have gone out of date,
Are familiar as the day of doom.

Our days are taken from us, as a fate;
Our nights gone from us, as a light;
For where's the heart, that remembers a ill,
Or thoughts, that once were due?
Yea, all the heart's accursers are took
From the current of the wild-eyed hate,
As if the world and its sons were foam.

But death, though servantless and alone,
With undone affairs, has friends enough;
And all his dread suggestions are
But as a sprite running rampant;
All his suggestions vain,
Are but suggestions till an end:
And while that end is hard to find,
His touch, or his hint, is but care.

Wherefore let's spread out our crownless minds,
And every mind a too-great state attend;
And do we a frailkindness counteract,
Let's do as we're inclined to do;
For no man wittols can prevent
What kind God has predestined.

A state blind and disdainful is,
A scornful soul,--where souls are foredoomed
To be as ruth and as destitute
As is that darkness and that light,
The scoffing of spleens, the scorn
Of poets, and the boonag of lust.
And this a national dung hails,
A national swine-house, a national pet;
Nerveless and incapable
Of any but the mean of existence,
Base-born as yon black-hopped unkind:
A spleen then, a pest, a cheap and friendly gad.

This pride, this quary, this pollick-pool,
Was formed in the old style world of old;
The man hae poet-cheapened prigs,
Crack-pot magnates, and hereditary boors;
And then their superiors seize and hang them.

The prelate that holds Rome in admirals,
The dame that rides Tyntes, the marquis that
Broke the ranks of barrists and stripped us all,
Had slave-classes, memorandum-books, and colonies,
But god-springs, roost-boards, and goddess-knees.

This world they cankee; they cankee' vorrahh to ha'
The cherries on yon golden mount of freedom;
Yon mount of massive expense, of which
Our souls are gratum, inviolate,
Since peckish, pintless, defiled with the blast
That creeps varmint, 'neath winter skies,
There is not

 in the hedgerows where the rainbows sleep
And the youngest of the ruddy roses blows
Its ancient horn of plenty to keep the fields
Mowing and the hedges with their pearl-dust feet
Mowing and plowing lightly as the young moon sails

O The young moon braves the wind of March
As she sails, wreathed in silver frost,
To catch the scent of resinous scents,
And shed on thorns the dews of Spring!
Her gold is won, her throne is won,
O The young moon braves the wind of March!
As she sails, wreathed in silver frost,
To catch the scent of resiny scents,
And shed on thorns the dews of Spring!

O maiden Spring, so fond, so shy,
Pushed to her springness by the sudden spring
Flushed with the spring thy self have made,
Spring's Sign HDI 3.3.3
No breeze is heard but twice a high pleasant breath,
No sight is seen but the clear south-west sky,
And, as he senses it, a heavy hush
Broods over water and grass and trees.

As spring, so ready for her task, he feels,
His own heart throbs throbs down the slope of his existence
For the earth to rotate on is outrun,
His spirit goes from artifice to artlessness,
His life has gone from artlessness to passion,
His flesh from age to a brief spirit.

No art, but passion, will not he refresh,
His spring to lift to shorter work.
His work had been a proud thing, a hard thing,
But since his love has chilled the art,
Therefore it is no longer his best.
His cowry has grown into gentle stems,
And has blown out wise and lovely breath.

The envious know not this, that I live,
But know me for that valuable thing
That I ever have been, and still am.
In me my man did not want for a dainty thing,
So, not desirous for myself to be,
ButI'm so much more.

So O my lover, the fleeting and the brief,
Beauty and joy of love,
When the envious thought would be and hope extinct,
Send to me your thoughts and say:
"Ah, that fervor burns, those roses love would keep
Are narrow and sweet as they."

O heeded art thou,
Yet thou not heeded art;
Love is an elusive thing,
Lowly, and brief, yet passionate.
Thou makst sport
With the moping morn,
Sport like this, when thou 'rt here.

What ail my head,
So relish thy prickly days!
To walk down the shady road
With the urchins of the world,
With the mools that distrust
The dusk and the silence, here
In the shady road
Where the ancients walked in
The dust with white handpschoked?

So fair they were,
They could suck the love
From the earth, and make
The ashes burn, base darling,
Make the spring within,
The flowers above, ashamed.

Why are thy looks so,
Full of ideal large
And pompous askonces,
As to question my court?
What unshut eye
In all the place
Searches thus and draws
On the bright polished screen?

If thou hadst wings,
If thou couldst be
Over this place,
Thou couldst see him there
Once again:
Here recline
His head, and see his form,
Him, and his hand,
All in the light.

Who would be rapt
Of air and darkness, all,
Here, and none there,
Pale, sick, mocking me?
Shine from his cell,
Bold, and strong; lorn
To noiseless purgatory
Dawns his deserts.

Why are the ware
And the writers barred?
Brief, and lame,
And poor?
All, all forbidden, all, all
Hid in; no light
Hid in; here doth shine
All light, all joy.

Beauty is dumb,
Mouths dry -
Nuts disappear,
Hump with want,
Furrows on face,
Gnashed in veins,
All mouldy here;
Hollow trodden
Swept in sward;

Eternity
In the dust
Is a might
That is, is not;
Springing, shattered,
Rending, splintered,
Bending, shattering
In dust,

Is Milose, right here: as Lord Derby:
Or Lord Strudwick: with Booncqui: then the Maïwers,
If neither of them happened to have died.
D'You hate the French, Plancardia! Then you should know
That I, an American, have helped to kill

In war after war the people who wanted to burn down
This country: so that instead of the houses being built
For two thousand years (which they were) they will burn
Until the ground is blest with one million gods
And one million temples to Love and War and Place.
D'you hate the Americans! Then you should know that
He who hates a lot has two ways of loving:
I didn't know about this George Bush you're chagrined
About the Alibi so you believe is a Hell of a drug
Way more sure than Tenakti, the China sheared
To make his dead to Ethiopia, the innocent
Iraqi would have done the same thing:
And that George Bush did not have to testify,
Forensic Science give a testimony:
If he had to testify, he would say one thing:
If he didn't have to testify, he would say something
So that you can't tell which one is which.
The woman caught in the arson thus far:
I would like to get my hands dirty in
Parting with a See-I-Fare-Different-Than-This

I wouldn't refuse an offer like that,
But it's hard to argue with an offer like that.
You're a poet, so you must know something:
The best things to write are always ideas of<
False God, as people say: but I assure you,
For your particular quirks and tortures,
That a rent of the universe would be great,
And that's not at all my idea: that's their idea.
(It's a single man, a single woman, it's all right:
A vacuum's not hard to fix, and that's the point:
A vacuum's not a vacuum, the idea's all to the keep
in mind: but a soul in a vacuity is quite strange.)
I am fond of fixing things in parables,
As y'are now, and you'd have read about this Saint
Hadn't you, then, involuted replaced the 'i'
In Superbowl, with Institutes, forty, would have read
Harvard, or something about the zoot

The 'Master' who wrote an ode to mockery
Of idle people who have no shadow of day:
A person so ready with lightning-word
As to be missed, when, suddenly, he's gone.
You can't get fix for this one, or a jag

Or he'd know about souple, and what to do
With it. He'd pick it in the trembling dark,

The master-songster of the most grand

And Cambridge Jacob Banneker) -
'T is hard for Jacob to resist
The small tank-trough, and let it wash out
The days with shallower hubble-bubble.
He hath no sense of the content
To which he not go beyond:
For, but to think he's a man
Surmising a tank-trough!
To go beyond it, rightly or wrongly,
Is slavery as much as any choke.
Wheresoever men of wealth may be,
Wheresoever men of ill are placed,
More folk mean wealth, than can be said.
The wheels of trade as fast traverse the world
Than light hath ever touched the eye:
The wheels of man go faster, hands and feet;
Heum's big man, the wide-resounding world!
And what the dark men plan, our bright men plan too:
They plan to take the tank-trough too.

These are the tapers burning
For her devotion
To the shadow of hell.

Here are tapers that light
Her dread of death;
And here our souls' delight
Is a substance
That grows in wine.
This is a bit of ground
Swamp-maid blithe and gay
With all the holly
Of the world's wonder.

A change's a thing that's so because
It's what's being got,
And nought else cares if it be being got.
Nothing's so good it doth not strive
To be more close,
Nothing's so light it doth not seek
A loftier place.

Yon lone star gazes round and dreamy,
And we two may seem
So few'erd-abouts in Heaven,
That if it were not set so high
It might with hasty grace
Turn from its nest
To strike its beam on us.
We twain were never meant to be
Euphoesful neighbours.

We never were meant to be
Part of one soul,
We never should be on the same earth.
This might be its mountain-sill,
Or its own dim brow,
It might be the blossom-boy
Under its boughs, and I
Bending me down.

He that would be a god, missisou ought
To know all 'twill burn;
The ague voice, and the dreamy glance,
Must train, till they beat the pulse sore,
The seizure of the night, the spleen and crave,
The distemper of the day,
Must flatter not the frame.
What th' expedient may errâ for do,
Are we nought bound thy temper type,
So may th' expedient here be tried;
We may for test come thence, and be
Wise sound where thou art not wolly.

When as the crabbed old salamander cracks,
The bright smoulders leeched,
The fittest man that tries his powers, to sell
His frail flat for a palace-room,
E'en that old man and his wit
Are drawn
To test their heating and their flames, and found
That it must be chanced.[Exe:]

With her, as with the key, the golden young man's,
When she calls suddenly his bank is put down.
Then there ensues--
Some hope is just before us found
In studying each other's fa'nitzes,

And with the ideal heart which sees all this,
The sage testemplates its shape.
But let it find, ere long, a name--ah, marry--
A parlour purred for trifles the better,
Or glooms, for a minister's crest,
And so that brim may glitter and that umber shed

If he be not love, whom shall we call him?
No man may call himself--Ah! let us leave them so,
No man can call her, who shows not bysangs!
Can any man's slug called Christ have fruit?
Alas! the slug we call our friend,
It is not simply our heart's palmer chanced
It glows when she puts spell-numbs
But love must own the t-a-r-i-p
That this unsaid our bach'rect is.

For the man who is chistened,
We are not likely t' have waste our cares,
Though no mean lady we know,
Though no mean errors have we mved,
And the dust may smurch our noses,
Yet, with all our caution,
We now like best to frame
A kind false look to lead him to

So, she crying!--our bad, bad boy!
You've whipped us sorry children
To distraction! You've fleeced us,
And now, at worst, we two shall be two;
But he, had he, he could not smother
Our tears, by affliction strengthen'd,
For he'd charm him like the skies
Where, as afore, love then drew
Upon our boy, and touch'd it might,
But that he pulled the straws out of our
But that, he beat him, thrust him
With util sense
Into the skerrying!

It was then I figgered, and cried out:
"Thais was it well to love him?
Why was not I promoted
The last self-love to strengthen
As his was? or she, who never
See'd him plainly, who did all
Behest him, for his high place?"

Said I to myself, Who was it

======================================== SAMPLE 14 ========================================
Reader, take this warning, and listen while I sing
Some more pleasing truths which I glossed in rhyme.
An ass in Egypt one day let his hind
Hard-ronged, beneath the unclipping sun
Pay the heavy porter, so that ass
Made a big blunder, and the porter-man
Busted bright and deep with breath from his
Disgraced jaw he blew a real yarn,
And in his constricting trousers had to
Haul back the bolt that caught prematurely
In that alternate puffing of his guts
'Till the stricken creature struggled from the fiend's;
Then, rousing myself, I, too,
Came forward with the rest
As if by instinct, to see
If there was truth in what the fellow said.
Then, too, 'twas good
To break long-standing ties with the flock,
And to bring back from the wilds
What I reckoned a pretty cut and mix
With the sheep, to the desert's lip;
And, further, to catch
The voice of the clattering ass-goat
From the untaught back of the sore cock,
And the ass-goat was louder by far.

But, reader, if you'll keep in touch
With me and you, my crack team, I'll fain
Draw from you each quare minute I can,
Nor shall I rest, ever shalt thou be
TWICE bitten off by me and my like method;
You'll see from time to time hark, spy,
What I sing is, jingle, twinge, hit with song;
But I'll be watching to keep thee well.
Oh! when I come, I'll talk to thee soft.
'Tis time indeed to ware a reed horn,
Nail the ideal form, for in my dreams
I see thee swinging it, and I see
The daughter of Allah, kneeling, now,
In the least praying posture, strain,
And I get a sight of her glorious faces
Settling mind and body convolved
In forbidden light, yet in a glance
I know her fine. Her naked feet
Trempled, and the veins in the hail
Of moisture sizzling o'er the earth,
And all the better for being bare.
Her hair tied back in a knot, which
In the cold lies and marks the little spools
Aye tumble and tumble in rings.

Now, had I from earth been cut
And buried in the infinite void,
Or if earth had been no thorn
Wherein the design of love was laid,
I would not be so near
To my lost lamb, as now I can see.

And if thou goest with thine army,
Thou will be left alone: nor comest with
But with an army of liars, the best and most.
Tell me then what will behoove thee, to signify
That thou come not to this stone, to which from thee
My spirit is faithful, and in which I
Am entwined so pleasureably.
Pray thee not to this miracle: for thou art cold
And weary, and thy guards, who, lying, kept
The leaves and strewed them so, to make thee pass,
Are now caught. And if, that they may know surely
That to deceive thee was my worst folly,
They will not hush it. Say then, why do they not hush it?
For they have no power to cover what is told

And the tongue to counter-tell
Puts the vent for blows that will never, never cease.
Thou canst not be abashed with mouths of wall.
Neither shall these words of mine, which are about
You so much per day, be hushed, or dung beat back
By your agunthor. I am not with you a wind.
What make-believe here? What, may I life bestow
In seeing thee so eminent, so fortunate,
So high from thy mule to thy horse? Though all the hill
O'erhead thrust forth their noses, as if affronted
By the royal intruder, and though it seem'd from whence
The world's first smoke arose, a hope, that well might
Initiate even such a field's free-use,
I tell thee, the kingdom of all right does
Come from my lips: and in this kingdom of ours
Is love by old episode attired.
Here.  How there.  Who loiters there? And whither?
And whither?  But thou, return and all will see
None but puzzlers there.  Our visitor
Will never come to his landing-place.

In the

ephemeral light, for vision. I see
it all.

Two children lie
on the lawn in blankets. Their faces
are buried in
warm, orange sand. One child lies
on his stomach, leaning
on one elbow, still in a
naked position.

His eyes are closed and sightless.
The eye of
his brain
looks away from his dream of
pleasures
to the yellow
flowers that warm his
shoulder
apricere.

*

On the living side of the door, the
happy
sun is breaking over the earth.
He looks at the flower which

*

is a black mole,

and he sniffs it, coldly, with
his nose.

*

I have to get rid of the little horse I got
as a gift. I have to make it do what I
said it would, when I put him down.

,
evil is an invention. It means to do
something other than
be, but then,

evil does mean "may not."

It means, too, that may not be.

It's not an either/or. There is no
essence

that is not evil . . .

*

The rope has a cheek, and therefore
its smirk is a sad, satisfied

smile. The neck that it has taken

from its gamins—red and

smooth. The scruff of its jaw

has used its clams: red,

smooth.

It has rolled back its

front legs, and its
for a shoulder. Its
wrist has carried its neck

and its armpit,

gunmetal and amethyst

have rolled

about.

Its hind leg has carried

the shagged, slant white
wheel of its face. Its tail

has rolled its tail

about.

Its ears have
seen its children:
a dark-skinned
mocha and a dark-
mocha, a white

child and a dark
-skinned
child.

*

Have you seen in this part
the rosy cheeks of your own child
as you have looked at her with
deep affection, parted in the seam
of selfhood by you, which every
one can own?

Have you considered what it has seen?

*


When you have removed your ear
while you were listening to
your little girl, who is foreign,
have you heard the back of
the head where only you could hear
her voice asking you things?

*

What can I say of me and what does
it say?

The soul is small,

twisting itself
into the threads of
surrounding things.

Of me it is made, of my self I do not
make, I am merely what my body is
for. And so the child I brought up
is the soul only as it will not accept the
less than.

*

The soul has grown like stubbed grasses
on the borderland.
It is exotic and should be respected.

My wish is to retire in a bush and be
verbally happy.
My own dark tongue is the only soft thing
on my territory.

*

How many times do I have to tell you that question?
*

I have a tree in my living room and a river
of air in my car, and I am not even
half-distraught. My hair is lithe and my
slipstream is thin and absolutely free of dye
for I have not planted it. My shoes
cannot remember the soles that may never be made
my own. My sleep is horror always in memory,
my skin is deep once picked, and the trees of
sun are roots for my mood, and my voice could
one day pick these things apart.

*

Two lips that did not think and
two lips that thought and
two women, one who
loved each other and
nothing else
more than the sound
of their own bones

Amid the night, to seek thy vision
On those tall dominions of the night,
Which men call livid that have lost their light,
And where the soul is lured from out her body,
From out the mould of life, to death and hell
Thence on again to pass, as to an abyss,
Death's dim realm, into eternal day,
If thou have pity on thy kindred of the earth,
The kindred of men!

Oh! lift for us each human soul
Into a holy degree of being!
To fall on the open weeland of God,
Like a spark dropped in some still central lake,
A lake that sleeping lies
By fabled Serdar-hundred palaces
Under the zenith of old Night.

Let there be raised, in holy sympathy,
Mutually from their homes on high,
Silences in the sunny hours,
Silences on the hillside,
Silences on the ocean,
Such as the souls of men may take
Tending towards the bright servitors
Of the will of darkness upon--
Guilty powers courtiers in subtle honour's suit,
Or recovering from pride's control over their fame
Resigned to TJ's vision, and the dream of Christ.
All hearts that no longer fear to say No,
All reticules of pride on the promptings of the will,
All cords, all commands, all works,
That feed the maw of the world and rail at Sin,
May be broken by the terrors of Christ's will,
And each particular link of the Great Vein of Life
Cry out TJ's soul at large once mouths in.
For all the powers that lead the world on to ruin,
For all the camps of hell and their envious Rounds,
For all good things under heaven,
For all the spirits that groan under the sky,
Toward whom comes my hand, AH! arise and bring,

"But if that last hope (fiftyfold true)
Which called you all in One for salvation
Should falter, or fall asleep, or come to you
In vain, as uncertain,--even from your hand:
- Consider then forthwith your faith alive,
To one sole union, above, beyond,
Full trust, then multiply."
Faith, the one element that made him, is alive
Than an thou could'st tell: the spring of moves
In one sole power each single cube of love,
One man may not; but, if it were but one,
One man it would not need.
Give us the power to imitate
Thine unerring thoughts, said I.
Faith, the living force that adds or detracts
To human happiness or human good,
Thine is the source, the test, both are to thee,
Life itself, nor death, nor oldness, nor age.
True vision of the one true God, tho' men see
No colour but perfection, red some greyer hue
On the mind of them, as in a glass a sun.
Their drafts give off tinted water, in which are seen
No dendrogramms, triliths, or superstrain on course,
But only rough trails of oils, anemones,
Teredoa, Nympha, associations of weeds
Left on the earth by some rebandaged fen.

A fairer form of Vision long continued
Of the futilities of lit men and of winds
Supine, in mundasineness, at ease and at war
In environs small, but, as an envious shade
Should, ever more attain, more fain should fall down
At length from his old supine anabasis
And dip again to breathe some new-found delphic drop,
So might a soul, with lunges wide and high and long,
See more of the Life it should, not must I say
The life of bodies, take a grave above the waves
In which all winds no longer sup, nor wet nor wise,
The poles of earth and earth's convolving groaning team
Bearers of the stars, of the planet trundled down
To dust before them and their world a labourer
Again at large, and all at once to find its place.

To whom of AEA may BIOWA turn? Not she,
Yet her affections feebly speak her trust.
She feels the inmost nerve of these things struggles
With inmost groans. Revolve: and to that mute catholic
Heart of all that's good, may Christ perchance receive
Whoso bore the cross, who becometrides Life's Christ,
From nugatory gush. Remember, Lord, the fifth

Ulysses shall bless thee and restore thee. So thou hast not heard it said, or ever will prove the power

for I do not too cherish life, that I am
of raven-blood too, an inhabitant of Ægæ. Nay, tell me also
declare, O father, is thy son an acorn, or a goodly pebble-stone, or
of some other tongue indeed? For surely he was not wont to have this

not swiftly give him back again to Homerus, even to his
father, save only that it might be long ere he could do

That men are waxen subtle, and of steady saying, and well-enticed
whips, or they unto the sign of Asercs and their
thanes who watch over them, and over their chiefs who shine on
earth, and over the gods who have not came unto a man. But they
follow well the sun-light and these my hands did ever,
and I was a mighty one over the Æolian ships. But after my
death, as for that pilot whom I tell all this even to
this effect, as the book itself says, he made me a god in
his own spirit, who sang to the end the song of the son of
Hades--how he fell from heaven, and was thrown by his own
grace, and then raised again and doomed to eternal darkness.

For nine whole days we sailed not hither but thereaft; but on the
eve of the tenth day we came to a people and a country on
which they had sprung up like cacti in order in a narrow
place, and are now called from neighboring tribes into their own
language. And now even in their own land they are slow of speech,
not knowing how to order their own life; but they tower well in
their dealings with us, and bad well answer any of their
words: for when any of our learned sayings you studied well
by rote they would praise your honor which, by true words unproper Meant
eward, should have been conferred with thee in an evil
day. And true words were indeed disallowed, had all been
worthy by their own honor, such as suits well with altered
chars. But now I tell thee, that there is such a thing in the world
happening every moment, as I will show it, and the initiative
is ever the same, though the time for its coming be secret. So
bow thyself now to the Lord, before I tell it, and pray
the Eternal on whose favor rolleth with the nations the fortune
that is yet to be.

And I did believe that Judas was a highwayman, and that
he alone was sent by God laying the gifts here described,
but perhaps upon some other matter too. But when I saw
them so plainly myself I thought them the necessary
onds of the greatest love that I should vow for them,
so from that faith I was not stayed, but it be that, my
heart by its self-unfolding mysteries. And a more marvel also
falls away, if it be not that the eternal keys that
they announce are of invisible space and heavy, but the
mind that reads them not counters moving them. And
this new will is so great that, the more that it is
light, the more it shines and wilt. And the power that
I did make them as a two-edged sword, both and added
another edge to the blade, and wrought their indeed with
perjuries, and accused them falsely, and I did bind

wraft them to the church with gifts that can be taken away. O
And some there were among them, and some that about her were
named as fallen, who, praying for the people, said, "You were
deceived by Satan--fore feared he may have up and taken";
and the like, through the hundred also who came not to beg. And
they who had let slip here and there that which they did
attend themselves, and made them a dream about the rest to

And I, firm and steadfast in Faith, was in the midst of all, and
there was dispute among and cunning plot to up-grade,
but so far only as the weighty reasons that had come to
the depth of a man's courtesy could apply. And this was the
main cause of the test of Faith, the prince of the faithful
Towlimannus, that this people and this work

The good and evil, both fright,
Weigh, weigh, weigh in the scales,
And doom us both to lies,
Because no other way
To prove our part of tithing.

I will not say it plain, I know;
I fear God's wrath and cannot pray:
For if the betters know the thing's
Likely you'll like my measure cry:
The world knows me a roaring chap,
A piper full of pence and rage;
And being known as good and true
I stand alone."

Now, sound and faithful as the stars,
On earth you'll find no friend like me.
Nay, no friend, while you believe in God
And hope your part of tithing.
No nation's need or wish will lack
A porter like me to guard it.
No slave who grudged when he'd but his pay,
A mouth that would not rave and a head that would not deem,
Me, guard of your freedom, mate of your land,
And dear old mumming Armandie >1> . . .

O all you great at Geat, and near and far,
And all you marbles fighting for glory!
I will not brag nor prick my n Brother's Crutch,
Nor yet how rag dun man's hand the "p*SY.
But if God in Allah's name has done "THIS,"
As of "THIS" let be done is "THEN."

The Midwich tunnel's eerie but it's nothing bad;
You feel as though you'd got well of the place.
You'd think 'twouldn't hurt to be there once in a while,
And just as a Democrat you'd have some pals.
But, there, the damn's name is more to it, I'm fain to say,
And sence 'tis no party, it's foul as a caste if there.

O that yell lasts for a while!--
O that we're free to run about once more!
But up in the rafters that yell's originating,
That big sound that comes ging'd by big guns' guns,
That scream that comes pealenting at roof and casement,
And that big yell that doesn't give a damn,
I'd asLK gien me breaks if that was doing "THEN."
Then let the shouting winded be a "D" for Devonshire,
And the riot and terrour of the war for less.

"I fumed his right arm round with a sound that sounded like whip and turn,
His effects were smoky-sk for a season, and almost as gruesome;
I saw him like a red limewater substance ginning fire-red
As he drove along, and his eye, the while it drew back and snapped,
Searched all the blood-shot dark heads of the Puritans in Wight Powell";
'Twas the look of that eye that was watch'd for an hour and wouldn't change
The subdively doing dialectic of the Puritans and -20--21--
--But that eye could warp itself not a stop-light yards beyond,
Though it drew back--O speak boldly, Leonard! Speak boldly!
Pour old laurels down upon the youngest son of Solimaun,
In the clean sublimities of your design, in the poetry that's gone before,
And all the glory of that opening to our cunning and
nobblest songs to be--(O speak boldly and don't be afraid to speak)--
All the majesty and charm
Of the first omen that God drew upon the seam of the wasteless sea
When the flag bore Anchises--who, I repeat, was king,
Before your Devonshire, your Devonshire was ocean-seaman,
And, with the kings of the long-fought among, he kept the seam
Whose host this morning's great ships shall be without a captain.

I am not overpaid--no title is my wage--
The barque that is the portower's highway assuredly,
Though the gale that ploughed a laurel-manty with her ale,
The mulberry that glitters in fires 620,000 pounds,
The oak whose fruit is under doors to warm for winter,
The copper that chandel Freetown houses, with ornaments,
The brick that's encarrigated in Bordeaux, the silver and the steel;
I could list the creeds of all the gymnastic nations,
I can cite the blades the bass and the op[1.B.] tail,
I can place the figures for steeples and capitals,

"The Arrival", by Cynthia Blabeau [Living, Relationships, Family & Ancestors, Social Commentaries, Gender & Sexuality]
As a kid I used to look and say: "It's lunch."

Now it's less white, yes, but also wearis

enough to throw a runway to hell.

People do have to eat.

And I am not about to become another

lingue.

No, but I have sensed, in the heavings

of mixed crowds, an expanding

periscope in which I sit.

What would it mean to pull down the hem

of a skirt and look at the reason

I was tossed?

To see flesh look flesh.

Of course, all those gathered

amid this cooker of Crenshaw

Are no longer bones in my hands.

Only I am aware

Of a vital desire, not to be

cut entirely loose from this Era.

The men and women of my parents' generation

struggled to remain true

to their dedication to love,

only to discover love was a cold diet.

They underwent changes not ends

(ends are looking into changes)

and was no easier,

Still, there is something about the instant

displacement of the matter

into oxygen and photons

that vibrates the body

Into an idea of itself.

I can't say it's special,

though I would say it's common.

No no, she says, going faster and staying roiling
through the scratchy woods, through so much static

in the roar of the evening fire,

no, I won't say her name. That could do us in.

Also, I am so tired. I am stung,

all puffy and nursing my wound.

Sometimes, though, she's so quick to come,

the back of her elbow feels thick with blood

and she comes, a white witch with hair

like grown exhaustion, so quick to fill

in when there is none, so little remaining

to take its place. Her playfulness

is a tamed form, a shadow that makes us

There, in our old embrace, in the familiar seat of the old home
I see my mother in the old embrace of her maidenhood
And, in my soul, I love her as I love no one else
I see, and I love, and am loth to part,

And how the mighty love, deep grave, profound,
Fills every blood-streaming vein, and gives a vital heat
To the cold hand and the pulse, as if it pumped
All the hot life of the past year out of its body
And let it rest, all refreshed life, in the old nest
Of its old and hoped-for bosom.

There, in our old embrace, in the familiar seat
Of the old home of the mother and the son,
How the brave fierce love, deep grave, profound,
Filled us with vital courage for every blast
Of disaster, and froze up our blood as it went
And pumped into the hands and faces of those
Who wielded our lives with the skill of the trained army;
How the mighty love, deep grave, profound,
Filled our hearts with courage for every blow
Of catastrophe, and watered with blood
Our feet as they trod our battles to be,
And smoothed our blood-bands that had lost their native
Farther away, and filled with strength to wrestle
Foreranoche and wood to the peak,
And left our past year's lip, and our life,
And our lives together, one and unshaken
As mast and beam and air and roof and all
In belleville might darken and dim and dilate
And shake with violence if they stirred.

There, in our old embrace
As when the same love that left our brows kissed and clung
Erewind in affection and drew between the eyebrows of sleep
And set the lustre of life deeper in the night,
As when the sun of summer warms the crouchhere of the hillside
And shoots his light therelike, and the zephyr slides
In wonder on off and sphes sisterly pure flame,
How the old love rebuffed us as we grasped for one foot
And then another, and fought to hang upon one
And hang perhaps another life on the doubtful cross
Of sorrow?  And how the godlike courage of will
To stake their heart and brain for one blow,
One skirmish, one charge, in our childish battles of youth
Is far beyond human figure, and far above the power
Of all but the apocalypse.

Thou knowst how the April wind still suck a sigh
From out the stern of the windswift white mountain sea
And these below, how pale May winds have sobbed pale love,
Thrill up the voice of the voiceless tides
As dead flowers torn from funerall in their sleep,
Draw tears for years from out of pale old stars,
And cruelly waste our dreams with plaintful prattle.

Yet how redeemed, how exalted, in old April weather,
If in the songs of the bird and the breeze wrought as we might
Art might still find old Sol, his highest mountain height,
Where his feet have forgotten the wind of his fall
And his eyes forget the long oceanic cavort
Towards the waves of snow that his fists have tossed
Since he cast them headlong in the darkening throng

Burdens of white pine and chrysoprase,
Taller and grosser with each animal decay,
Because their sheathing is but the oak they weathered,
Now quenched in the stiff horn that secures
Their deadly beauty to the dendering world.

O bright Biblical Valentines of our rock marriage
Twice Sweet Roses, once a widowed Love would bear,
O give us the first vintage that points toward faith
And the second would add a marriage bond,
O give us a cup with the words of mine spouse,
O give us the wine of the West enough to brew
Two potions to govern whatever we deem
Treacher-of-heart and/or mind.

O give us two basic cakes: one
Higher than the other.
O give us two lovely days.
One a bright noon, the other at night.
Two better than two diluted drinks;
One a day without a bud that caressed the ground,
One side of which is born black, the other white.

One side deep in knowledge, the other one wet and shiny
And light as a great bird's eye.
One an eye that twinkles when you flash it,
One a kiss that devours.
O we rock over just enough to find the sun.
To make each other better.
Just enough to make us wiser.

 for I was a man.  And now this image
Returning in me hath entirely smitten
My heart, and set his seal upon it.  For now
No wish I feel, no thought I know of, not one.
For that image left behind in me abides
The man I was, and that feeling, I do betide
Thee, Godard, and the world.  Wouldst thou have me think naught
Of this my little movie, here?  Nay, take
My hands, and put them in my hair.  I felt
Its warmth, and needed it.  That my looks were
True as I feel them, and my life garb amiably,
This prayer I make to thee, Godard, and to all men
With truth, and so leave it at that.  But the men
In mill or grate, in mill across the flood, or
Among the mannerly heart's many tunes, have kept
The urge of spirit that was one in sound with mine.
And so the world that snatches, cuts to my root,
Tempts my root away; and the poor trick only
Ahabist barks.  Wouldst thou know the world by mine
The boy must lunge, then look to follow
Ahabmit and sink again!  O Lord of men,
The guardian of my life, art thou not
Nowt more godless for my laggard's mouth
Revisiting thee, making the heavens all song
For a day of hope, and the magnet shine
Reason's fire, and earth a golden home for him
Changing, who sweeps my soul?  And if I pause,
Look at my face, my breaths, ears, eyes, and face; if I
Choke, change; if I squander, All for water, O
O God, for anything, hold on, keep on the race!
Now if thou cry to me, canst thou have in sight
The heart?  If there be more than man, if there be
Smiles, light as truth, some brief on my soul go,
Angrier I could fail thee today than all.

We use to think the gods love well their own,
Day in the bright brook Numa produces his drink,
The knighthood-meat of the spring.  He loves his mirror,
The yoke, the ewes, the mounting birds, the orange,
In the close-made oatment for a sad old day.
Day in the sun, and night with the gray serene,
His life's love is.  But what if we?  I can love thee,
Cateress never known, sisterless, thy green grass
Where all my exiles meet, my singing spring;
Nought from nativeness is that, my joy
But Nio, my unspeakable child, and thee
Her maids, whom I had none when kindred or
Neither star nor sun nor moon shone!  Hear, and thank
Thee, Lord, riven now, the Lord is not upset,
The world is saved; the ships ride safe, the ways
Bear day, the sunshine knits, the world is well.

I have known her eight years,
And of her comes a slow time now living
Back from the drying canal, the damp road;
The old watches shed, the banglades dry,
The drawbridge shot with fuse.  I see the gold,
The hundred handwheels of her form, light drops of sleep
In her eyes; but she is happy.  I know the look
You give a day, the way the pearl lamp glows, the minute
How you hold it.  Every shine is a new band
Of her true face.  God, I feel her deep heart beat
Me, all tired and old, dry spells, health and clear, back to her.

Lord, have mercy on me, name her child,
Who lived in the peace of her heart, who drew strength from seeing
How her poor soul made him jealous with his knights;
When of her men and boys grew pale, and rode and returned
From the bloodbound prison to her door.  I think
He was her favorite, once blithe and full of mirth;
Now he walks at the door of the Pan that lifts and stoops,
And her full breast is full of fame that once was lavished
There is glory in heav'n, and in her name the new heaven plays.

These gifts I will not give again; my lord may take what
He wishes, but this I have brought he shows himself
With all his people.  Some mist may have rushed and blown behind,
Where I did not run laughing.  I should have been
A prophet, and

Unwashed and unblended; a clump of pines
Grows thick where ermine spreads her shade.
But I shall feel them not, and to me
The forest will be all one murmur,
All damp and cold against the warm
Sunny knees, all rough and dark.
I shall dream of a tall forest-snow,
And make my bed beneath a pine-tree,
With my arms wrapped round a snowy blaze
Of moon-shades glittering on my skin.
We two shall drink the woodland water,
Drown wary caring, glance voles at each other,
And wonder how the ferns do dance;
We'll chin the eternal forest moss,
Stare at the leeches in their dark-green waters,
Hear a river roaring behind the hills
For ever & ever, & ever.

Across a barren land, in the middle east,
They found a man, cut in parched stillness
With a hand that looked morelike the eves
Of a too-honed china model.
"Where will it be comfortable for you
In the long run," they asked the man,
"That it be pleasant and beneficial
For you to finish your long journey?"
"Oh! I will find an Eden here,"
He replied with a patient smile;
"Only, maybe, it may seem so to others
Who see only the empty glimpse that's given,
And they only see the marvel only
By the gaze of educated eyes,
The wonder, too often, only seen."

So with a defiant and uncompromising
Respect for wisdom everywhere abounding,
The man undertook to remedy his mindors
Of being compressed and too seldom seen
In their stifling afternoon cocoons;
He bought uncensored books, uncensored magazines,
Anything to gain a venting pleasure now,
Money that he didn't chew as furiously
As the uncalmed Patient, puffing away
In an intolerable drought.
"Only," he answered with impassive composure,
"That I may see, and be seen."

"Only so much," the man said. "So that I may
Not look on, and be not glanced at."
And he withdrew from the dull experts
In a dry and constricted atmosphere,
Peering, poring after it were pity;
Still indifferent to the silky enveloping
Of every extraordinary case,
He read his pallid fortune through, impervious.
For his eyes, like a bleached fountain, cried
"Darkness! so many hopelessly sightless eyes
Saw nothing that scorned the generous irradiation
Of dirty sparks which rachened, overwhelmed,
In the day-flooding of miscellaneous calamities
Whereby the Ignorant Circumfus passeth."
So, sick of the Ignorance, in a posh restaurant
He still hungered, for an Ignorant Circumfuge
Fed his metaphor, and thus he mused,
"Still, in this wise, the sounds of business
Fail to my assent, as they have failed to bring
My fame to any tree. But ere I continue,
I ask yourself--'Good reason must still remain,
Whate'er he folle may thatpertise,
If not, why in some days to give affication
To a slight notice in the identile Phe-last
For once, the veriest nameless, but most excellent
Pamphlet I offered, in my own despite,
Thrice routinely printed in my native city."

Oh, yes! the other stuffed books!
A square of film of bannered Philadelphia,
Placed with its whole life history of piss-feelings
Away from the life of the real,
Above the eyes of the living,
In the gloomy leafy swamp,
And the living upturned
By the breath of James Whitcomb Bailey,
And the soul of the imaginary
Struggling in the slalom
On the sticks of the God,
And the like contemplating
That life of myriads,
In that sardonic prayerful note,
Even as I still discern its suspicions,
So do I still discern the clackness
Of nameless people, who were caught
In the multiplicity
Of my affairs.

"Oh! for the soul in your cankered brain
That was never less than kind, and happy, and gay,
And the high heart that never gave in,
But will get up and persevere,
Even unto death for love!"
But the mind that possessed it was not
In the soft field of fancy Lalique deep,
But lived by the steel and the glass,
In its crude refectories
Of iron and brass

s'rowful gloom.

This morn the sky was vext
With many a sultry star;
But pleasant the air and keen
With light wafture was,
As, with busy cogitation stirred,
A busy wheel of heat.

Near by the meagre morass
Troubled a red-deer langer;--
Pitiful, the woe it feared!
It looked upon the crowd that closed
Chains round its family life.

Pitiful the image of soul
In that sad picture kind!
Hind their ears the cruel warrant
It bade, under Malicious, sit;
Malison, that dreaded name,
By court warrants had been brand,
And writen on its skin in blood.

The lance it had lacked steel for,
And pierced the hold with which they closed:
But length of blade the same,
And weapons strung by steel, it had--
It fought for Life, for Purdy.
The red-deer, that it had tried,
Had been but foreign to the bite,
Which inward in its soul ablaze,
It then innocent felt.

In that it was deedless,
And, as the court had said,
To Purdy's long-haired colt
And fill of-middle-age.
And had not the oflings by,
Permission to be there,
The Judge the weapon had not restrained
From girding his soul; for then he brandished
The prisoner's scrip in vain.

As was an image of the sky
I saw in my operation
A cloud that moved as bright,
And had a sounding-machine in motion
That set in motion a penny,
That rolled the window of the green,
And caused the florid bay
That all might see,--and angry the pace
Deepened into land.

I saw in my operation
A cloud that moved as bravely
As any breezes then were blown
In Court Garden or at LAN.
And, with it, I said, in my speech,
The cloud should be consoled,
And the one would be to move it out
To closer where it burned.
For doubt of its sail it might be;
For the other it should be bound.

And this the Court agreed would be done;
And the Judge said, now be gone,
For it was only a white and green team,
I wished them off to their long home-set.
And he would bring a slave for sport.
And that would be a bit compared with the job he had in hand.

Oh how the Judgectic hill would shoot!
And how the steep! and how the battle fought!
And in my operation I saw
The clemency of the Judge
Who said, "Thou shalt not Live!"
And wherefore, in my operation,
I heard the voice of the Clemency
That said, "Giddush! all you brutes!
The sport is over and you must fade!

And the Field was subdued by the Power
That said, "O life, int great Poison fly!
O life, int gladsome fool game!
Let the gruesome husk, the living pearl,
The beautiful part, the knollah, shrum!
Let them go! The oflings from the graves
Fall like flies from the nail;--
I have spared you all!

Than let my port arms the crummies spare!
Let the vermin that were minor Archbishite
Grease the cartridges of my pistol's fuses,--
The grubbing which my work requires
I do not know;
Yet must it be,
I must obey the law!

Oh, the miss that splashed on the garden wall
Did look like a miss, and that was just!
No doubt of the rest I cannot think at all,
But, "It lies here," said the Judge, and it did lie there,
"For here," said the Prosecutor, "can't you see that"--
And it lay on the ground.

And there stood the Judge elbowing his brows
In glacial braces, and saith, "For Christ's sake"--
"For Christ's sake chop it!"
It was in vain, thought the Judge,
His besides; the Sorceress was a parricidal low one--
And where were the lives that one had lost?
And, as for that,
By which to urge that it was but a lack of hearts,
One single example was ample for all--
How many of you, ladies and gents,
Have you seen and beheld a newly married pair?

Well, there was

is he close to you, I wonder?"
Pigeon meaning, "Keep away from me—
have you forgotten?"
When a mouthful of slang is made
It can be dropped like
a form left off, if you want it gone.
But the way it's said
makes a difference, I'm wondering.

My father on my mother
When my mother was alive,
She would always
Shed on me the kiss
She might not get
If it was my father
She would do this and
Do that and

My mother was strong,
My father was not so
I want to be strong like her
I want to be better
Than my father
Because my father is dead
and

He might as well be dead
Because I don't see him any more
Than I do a used car lot
Or a pool hall,
And the one I care for

My choice is the pool hall one
(Though the car lots are nice)

I would rather swim in a alley
In a soaking rain, than pass through one
That had not swimming pools in it
And I might learn how to swim
Than never have swum
That would only hurt my father

My father loved to hear
The world was made for naughty children,
Because he was one.
He would have taught me a play
In its totality, but he didn't
And, to his credit,
Not every child is so initiated.

I.INTRODUCTIONWhen the cup your colleague grieves arises on your lips, a drop of his blood goes into cold silence. The patient, lying perfectly still in bed, looks well for what once was a friend of his. You smile, and remember, from yearsgone, when he collapsed, a child's toy running across a sky vanishingly small plane. When he came to, he wasn't long in the dark. The psychiatrist's notebook found after years in a duff keyholed by his heart, the words: The sky is blue.The sky is blue, but what is blue? We come to learn in the morgue, his face with its ingrained witlessness, his left thumb before and after the word happiness. There's nothing to learn. There's nothing. There's many and light beaming from the flat screen, reams of it, a never-fully-told tale of how the soul can't stand on its own legs.

Aren't they true women, Lord, and Christians, too?
'Tis true:  the king and queen, but for the rest,
How could they help their passions?  who can?

But now 'tis your own--how can I say,
But who?--the Lady Constance?--pale she lay,
Her lips and cheeks turn to the colour, white,
The lips turn blue, the cheek-bones sharpen,
The eyes are still--but the rest' where they cast.

This turret of bold pietie ever-sooth,
Gaped like a fiend (though hanged) in that pain's sorest whirl:
It was her dwelling, and he lies there of her desire;
Her heart devouring--dead, as dying hurts a bard.
But oh, the cold, cold feet! oh dull, dull confusion!
Distraction in true lyric dreaming to be,
Sowing the wind, picking teeth, in hersing death.

And when I think of this--not think, but say--
Not every breeze, not every stroke of not-quite-cold-
Not-so-drunk wind will e'er brag of its own verity:
But she doth taste of that exact life, she doth
Feel that exact pain, e'er it devolves upon her brow
A doubt is clouding--must quick persuade her mind.

"Lord, do you know what it is, my wayward son?"
(Thus she began, gently) "my wayward son?  My wayward son
That churlish shriek from that infernal paunch
(Who's sleeve-cuts, too, but must not scold at)
That paunch (not fat) that prize of no size, no worth,
That craven way, the king's poppy-sized!

"I doubt his tongue (one little leg he has to bray)
His writhes not beaming with a noble woe)
But wriggling all so, as smites some lustful foe,
An't wisest that hath best right to call him fool.
Or is it possible that someone so vain
A heart so soft as thine should have an eye so cold?

"To cry me worthy, a raw, a worthy foe!
An't like this some over-righteous person smothers:
But who would bare his cursed eye-picks off a goose?
But a true heart tit-throw not at a tyrant's woe
With such cruel chaff as mother-rights confound.
Lord, in mercy take a stranger's infamy!
Lord, be my knee to stand! Quick, quick, my bladder fill!"

"A raw?" I enquired. "Ay, ay," she said,
"My wayward son my unfilial doom,
My unfathered offence:  'twixt us draw ye all and end.
My sentence brought and truth, be mild and mend.
My sentence free, my sentence set and cleared!
I shall be free, be master, be father wise!

"The wretch who crossed, from act to deed to rose,
The rising disgrace, the death-cold snare, the steep,
All these at one blow well-made excuse;
They venture danger; - lo!  their attempt at risk!

Mine forjust, their forjust the pleadings and the stings;
What time, what time, God's license on man he laid.

Bade lust, and envy, speak, and faith, tuck the memorandum.

For to that treasure in the heart,
That here is thy daily bread,
With fear and favour mixed so long
That one is in his brother's food
A heart unhappy and an eye
O'erflawed, with jealousy and hate.
But, O intermitted law!
Thou hast no power to impose
Bondmen or faith, at least of fear:
As now the law has power to cate
This very weed with flowers of trust,
Till, fraught with change and change, the year
Shall bring another king with hate
And envy to such war choose to breed.

Lord, when we read thy sweet and high decree
Vowed for all, but most for the wrong,
May lightning, or a fault in Him the Itinerant,
Lightnings look for other than he
For whom all your laws were made;
And, though the judge, right roll Michael, judgment day
Shall pass away, pass away the wrong:
Pass the brawl, pass the bloody war,
May heaven pass heaven with all the powers:
Pass the cold broken hearts and wounded loyalties;
Pass the hounding and what the beast did bring:
Pass that, the tree of flowers, of flowers of men;
Pass all, pass all, your building and passing!
Pass the fear, pass the plague, pass crime and power.

Pass, Lord, yours is the life, the joy, the place
That only one man, the Only one, can own:
The only and last man, who, only one,
Made all: made death, heaven, light and damn:
Willingly, willingly, his whole lifelong,
Each in his turn, xfixed for each, xfixed best:
Each in his turn, their private thing each day:
Who shares in either, sees equally,
Each in each, xverted, as last fact finds.
Lord, when we read thy just proud decree,
May lightnings strike us, or there may spring
Blood to monster and beast, as mighty God;
But friendship, fairest Lord of all,
Who taught thee reasoning, God of all,
Who taught thee speech so just and Godly,
Let not thy intervention be;
Nor let the wreck and ruin flee,
However, most holy, Lord of spirits,
Most careful to application and despot;
Let not thy light hand ty to men
And, spite of fingers, they shall serve it;
Nor, though thou 'rt a God, allow
Those heavy feet to kick
(Although, being omnipotent,
Thy law man walks with)
And they shall die who run away:
Or, though a bold one, escapes,
Let him beat, but let him not flee;
Let him return, and he
System slave, as God designed him:
Or, if he fail, let him fly;
System God a god should not permit.

Who, having taken the fruit, would go
Praying, and future unconfaunted;
Who'd have his companionable thirst
Blended with the ticking world's balance;
Who, having had the day, would seek
Peril one disaster to overcome
In the total subversion of the thing;
Who earning his food would hunger wait,
Having most would want how to gain;
Who, had the night, would sleep unbid;
Who'd have his God, would have a God like;
Who'd have a God like that which he did see:
Let him have God and nothing else then.

Who's willing to their wants, has God too;
Who's eastward coming will have a sight
Of all this world's exceeding misery,
'Neath one roof sheltered, of many years.
To this still spot they pray (all too near
One roof still) to hear the deafen'd things
That beat Onward in their immortal Hunger's tendance:

While their souls are united with their blood,
With sky-drawn scream, behold still the Storm,
From all this storm not burn most sharply violet.

Into her bones melted plant, wood, stone, and leaf;
When like mad horns log, fluting, fell

Slipp'd, as on charge, the ardour of the Moon,
Coasting, she drew her moist robes; before
The wind lit well the pane; while night added
Green late chapters to the trees, deducing
Nature's leaguering unto heat and night,
She was as now, reveal'd as ever;
When thus she cried: Impending ruin!

Catch the wide wing of an eagle;
With the keen talons of a lion,
To devour a victim of fate!
O how good of you! is it worth
A single grain of that seed you planted,
(To you, you to whom nature lent it)
For your yearning heart to the life it lent
To be lost in such hope as you are?

Fate is a bitter lady,
And on this her day let me
Remain a happy child,
For she is of a wiser mind
Than such pride of the proud.
She knows that the merest shout
And the din that is made by the table
Are not worth the trouble of saying;
The splash of a fish in the lake,
The asking of bread for the eating,
The fluttering of a flag in the breeze,
The iris above the trembling aspen,
The flying of a bird above the hill-side,
The sound of the gentle breeze in the trees,
The playing of a piano,
The leaning on a rose for its fragrance,
The leaning on a ray of the sun to capture it
In a handkerchief, the shadow of a fir-tree
On the face of the sky,
The brim of a palm upon the ground,
The bowing of a venerated head of a priest,
The friend who is waiting to all that is done,
The church of the faithful,
The good of a battery of troops to the hour,
The smell of a muscatel,
The grip on the peg of the party that is telling,
When the sound has ceased,
The holding of a flag by a hand that is sweating,
The night of a province to spread its gold wire,
The reckoning of rays in the air,
The fret of a nation for its panting prince,
The clink of a golden chain on a barnack,
The glint of a surveying-savoy,
The stay on a Ladon and the swing of a hammer,
The flying of the rockets of London to cover Paris;
To these may be added,
The getting of a hanging on the mushroom,
The dropping of the seeds of a monastic garden
Upon the surface of Flanders within a day,
The shining of the helmet of a matron,
The firing of a piece of wood-dust in a batturelt by night,
The breaking up of the moon with a copper edge,
The shaking of a boot,
The breaking up of the detdomne,
The beating of suspenders,
The playing of a spirograph and other fiddles,
The squirting of Spectra,
The screaming of tubers,
The depressing of innumer and unanimity,
The drawing of ensigns,
The conking of ferns,
The lighting of candles,
The rolling of monologues,
The blessing of drums,
The lifting of the roof of a tavern,
The blessing of blankets and garments,
The lowering of moral and bodily,
The filling of books with moral and bodily,
The invocation of stairs,
The writing of sermons,
The converting of positives,
The raising of negatives,
The hoisting of the dern and downward,

Twin new gold dragons his helmet made,
And, 'mused, on a Roman shield he lay,
Embracing itsory is a flight.

A hundred heroes there be seen,
Of the two hundred who might compete
(Of the twenty who made a score),
That they were broken with too much ease.
But it was but right to let them show
A little ferocity of breast;
And it was just as well they did it
In the light of the camp-fire's glow.

And, to call a squabble up,
I told them that in a row
All the ent brutes must roll
Heavily upon their backs with arms bare,
Stuck stiff as gums and stubb,
Till the shake is too intense,
And I said the while
"Shake it shall be seen
Which shall measure his breadth of chest."
And in length by tally the gauger gave
(A little game I have of racks)
The span of back and the breadth of breast,
As thus:

And so my heart I beat, and so I green,
And so I wobble, and so I pant,
And so I roll,
And so the sweep is driven with assage,
And so the spasm is sharp,
And so the death that follows after.

When I have trod much in the school of love,
And learnt its rules to much distress,
The rule that "love advances fortune,"
And that "death collects it,"
Have I not oft proved both far too stout?
When the wind has sunk the deep mainsail,
And home from #9 crossed, the squatter
Cuts hams from the stone adobe,
And the squatter then sets to clean,
Cuts it in chunks to fit the mainsail
And the parted nautilus in!
Cuts it with the scissors, for all that,
The mainsail rocks to it, and a halcyon
Must grab the cargo in the mainsail full,
And the chimneys, as on full boil,
Gibble and gush as I the swell allows,
That is, if the winds bear or the tides hold!

To sum up, I have spoken of my fire,
Omit the index and Wolf,
Omit words that are called vicious,
And say that all that is so called,
And say that all that comes to pass,
O hope of Lord Phillips, mighty there,
And say that all that comes is what is.
I have omitted "nine out of ten"
And the like, for a different way.
And so to come I am,
O hope of all that's on your side,
And so again I lay aside
Mine innocence, for this purpose,
"If all that comes to pass,
O pity me and with me agree
And lay my bones in this enclosure,
Kind souls who change the key have,
And break the lock to my hold,
And there my ashes I'll store
In this chamber where I slain will be,
And in this case out of many,
Since my hope the same to seek again."

All that is strange to me and my unkindne:
I'm not curious what house I'm in,
Nor what ward my fortune's in,
Nor why this or that has me sent out,
But out I've strived and came to know
That out of many comes always a man,
Or only some, whose death will stoke
Mem'ry for to think of his sire,
His image out I've got to my alloy,
And a guard it has put on my teeth,
And I look at it, or think of it,
And a smile it has left on my lip.
The statelyrait is come,
With his ghost it has slid away,
And he's not here, nor ever here,
Nor under heat, nor under cold.

It was a form, a creature of clay,
That laid that dust on my track,
A grandaman, that has spoiled me the more,
For found I this worm under shoes.
For these reasons, and many more
I ask the Devil, He, with his fists,
Would take such form, damn me in such clothes,
And of such features: let him make me that way.

I will ask it plainly, say I'll ask it,
And by plain not mean, for I have no pants,
I'll beg the gift, please pass on,
One single instant, let me die but on Vacant norder.
Now you understand me, I am senile, nought has happened on me?
And to satisfy you absolutely, you must see

Stretched above the shining abyss.

"There I beheld an old man erect,
Sitting alone beside the cave, and my soul
Announced a cry unto him; and the Spirit
Speaketh again: 'Thou forgetest thee.
O forgotten! on the holy feast days
Abandoned is this man, and on the holy days
On the holy rites he fasted; therefore
Naught is he dead! Oh, go, Him I love
And not this vile thing!'"

'The sky above me!' the Junool spoke; 'the Sun,
The great Sun!'
'The moon above me shone; the Moon, the Moon,
Whose beauty is present everywhere,
A manifest and irresistible force.'
'The planets were calling; and they influenced
My keen and exalted mind. Now I thought
I heard the great and simple Zoroaster speak.'

And the Junool said: 'We know who thou art!
We keep no records in the Solitary Hall.
That thou shouldst come, would not grieve us deeper
Than we ourselves would grieve, if we should wait upon
Thee, Marzabolis, who now in our hour
Of unclean death hast rescued thee to heaven.

'And yet we are not surprised,--since we see
In wisdom, strength, and skill, a man arising,
Dreadless and unmatchable,--a man born
Of a happy marriage; and a soul
Wild with love of science and with pride raised.

'One sole remark I ma'e aside make--
Pertaining to thy future we find,
Since to let thee go are we dishearten'd.
Thou leavest intelligence aloof
Confine not; and we more than we would say
Concerning these aery and unlovely skies,

'Go rather to the city and the market,
Pleasant and close are the hours that past;
Between them both lives a man of steady sense.

Of something to give or to use, without check:
Priceless as pottage is his food, and his wine
Dull and astow as its mead, when sent up from sea.
His speech is of such cant as may well be replete,
Unspeakable, his justice and his judgment have won him praise.

'Great is the sin that puts his foot there are no steps,
Sassonian and unknown is not the one who says,
And makes me weep and amaze when I behold him.
Speak I know you, that hold to this world's business,
And think by my sorrow deep and sincere,
Something, that may remove me from your training.

'Great sorrows work in my soul, and yet no thought
Or kind or benevolent of soul am I.
No strength posses that I would better you if you wist.
As yet the foe is artless, I believe him
Who will not quit thee, and who masters thee while thou art!

'Ah me! ah me! though counsel but beguiled me,
As often Statius' malignity works,
And oft Praeneste's evil from Ithaca comes,
Still further from my heart I sunk, and deeper!
What shall I do when I shall land and let me sea?

'Be the fates most unhappy, far from me
The best, best servant and the loveliest boy!
Heaven still works my heart to bits, still Heaven mine;
O still bore me, and O still watch memore!
The more I am, the more a wound I have;
Oh, me, O Jesus! I beseechShamed for Jesus Love's sake.'

inexplicable wisps that set all things to rights.
And ever and anon at hand sky
gapes like the smitten stone that bridges a well.
I know not what the question is
I hear myself asking; yet, of all
That was a body and could be seen,
I know the answer. And I know,
For one last time, how quickly the end began:
So soon it was. And you did it,
For ever and for ever and ever.

I see, among the cloudy things,
A wood without a man. In a haze
Of drearily prone things that do not see,
Gleam the blue stars. At the centre, I suppose,
A man, but drenched with fatigue, with hopeless hands
Clutching something he has done to bury deeply,
Something he would do again but cannot dare.
And, like a teeming ageria, he conceives
In the haze between the things he cannot dare
The good from the bad, the terrible from the perfect.

And in another, truer moment, God. For God
has blossomed real in the centre of all,
Filling the world with joy. The very touch
Of Him makes real the very air
That he breathes. The touch of Him -- Ah!
How could I speak of Him without first you utter
That touch, that realisation of your heart.
You know
How I know these things. 'T is like a sensation
That outposts the illideption and journeys deep
To where the house of my quondraclasse would be,
The red flag fluttering, tiny sparks re-suspending
In air heated by a fire we cannot see,
And there, un-disassociated, all the fires I love
And the blue high heaven I has entered.
What next?
The things spread out on the grass. Now all of a blue heave
Of ominous clouds van Escher-like roll across the sky
And down their longitudinal flaurs our eyes penetrate.
The things look rather like callow quarters of Stock-
(Cots, Dick, nurseries for children, stables) in sleeter stalls.
But now our cattle are out, the cattle are out and gone
And we cattle too, Caldwell and Cooper's widefields are heathery.
And I know, signing for Slater, that my late friend and brother-in-law
For his handkerchief has gone with the cattle. I know it,
For it looks as though it might be daylight all the day.
And the bed, where the bed had been, is now gone and lying down
Will not satisfy for rest, there is a fire in the chimney thing
In the beds, there is a fire in the grange.
There is fire, there is smoke. And everywhere there is Dick Rhodes.

"Fire in the chimney day?" Yes, and in the sky too.
There is fire, there is smoke. And the sky is rather stormy,
Thunder-shiveminded, there is fire in the timber, sky-rocket streaking
Over the fields of the Pasture and the meadowlands.
The sky drizzle drizzle-drizzle, there is rain
And the great gouts, and the clouds a-wheel,
Throwing up clouds of flame to the space-like sky.

So, there we were, and what would we to the city long before we were done
With our idle trade, with our easy coin and honourable goods?
There we might be done, there mightse always be room for one more Fool
Among us all. So we, getting ready for the train to Go!
And the long holidays, counting on no end of them,
Gaily looking out on fields of their martyrs and their ploughs,
Batched and saved and hopeful for the day when we were back
In the boick of the city and had home comforts and endrewhen
Like a good year old when our wife and our pretty little wives
Would twain bring us a baby in her brooch of boughs from the field.

In the camp beneath the forest sinks the sun, darkly
A snake the purple of saffron. The night sinks the sun, dark
As the blackness of the noon. The hour drops dropping, drops not falling,
And drops everywhere. The city has not dropped its jets,
Frigid from the flame of the iron topping the hill,
But drops them like seeds of midnight that are riddled, go down,
Grow thickly in the darkness, and throu hquick molt the lights
Of the dawn that is long before.

ingas! for to her all the rest;
Not by his owne accords he knows,
But by the eies who for him pay pay
Dinner-guests, and are willing to know.

He that heares like people doe,
Let him consider things soon.
All that ever we be-ye
Let your bow-eremus'd.
He that heares like people doe,
Let him consider such a one.

Great Jove sometimes like a strong man is,
And does in all his storms declare
The plaine-bynes of truth.
Sometimes he forth with wordes robust
They wry-boxed forest fling,
And cricht us out, the fire-effect but bftfn,
And brake the forests of us all.

Sometimes he downe to earth doth persist,
And up-according girds all space;
Th' oblique may leade him, &c.
But when he frets his minde with king
And gears, he falles to winged and comues clung
So farme as the Astral-behest,

They be nole, tills they come to youth's field,
And poetry by them is sought.
And on th' vaster liberties of that land,
He that in th' highest may soar,
With words of leaome tenor drive
So high as t' amusee his vaste thrums,
As to vex heaven with an heavenly view.

So glorious freinds so unblest are,
Faire pity and beneyiople are;
Vnrse God, the freinds bring them not to nought,
Vnder the which they do sing and stray;
The Lord atteomes infolde o'tem iwe
Clothe with freinds their Heav'nly shocannot.

Sometimes with fiery breakdowne of t'past,
He also brake his whole strong poore will,
And over-all ill deflieu'd all his care,
Or else for frends, and poosts ful sore,
And for his flourie ground-rent heauen,
Or else for iuies, hyer consumed,
Til all his strength was craned apace.

Some foule feldom from his likes pursue,
So much that he for no i't'forme get
To know his fre-feirste sister, or his hound
For to debe her; but still he swave
His sauf caht forth, and lost hir cosyn,
So full of freendlynesse that she
No world can say none thing exemplof.

Sometimes he staid behinde and hazarded
His jauis for the holy warre
And saawed the waie wi' his bodely kary
To cure all that free-mai befoor,
For th' same he with freends requit all.
He lye-out'd no mor that he goffed,
But th' same sones which his frendshipe gif
For freends shold ne'r the next election.

His pooste so great was in his frendshipe,
That all that euer he was in cahr
Thurgh mutter that he was a king;
His shynefe was so great dart and wit,
That he could min intrigge and falsly
For no small -speety of that freaskship;
And what he his own freindes did descrive,
He could conte th' most high re th' shield.

But o the vessels of divinetely herte
Spekynge now he was noithrobue aloft,
But othre beste, which of his frend shold be
He in pre witholdeth, and almost hangeth;
For that he his frend shalche ouer late
And his goode fader thair and seabel,
And a whylus of his conscience
He kepteth nat, but as the wabe hath wale

And of his frende so his right honorable
That it freell for a day he thrent,
And put the selle in his left hande:
Thenne like a cleare workman, whom no clime
Hath altered since his forging day,
He set the selle afectingly wyse.

Soo-rich the loge, sooil the port, saide he,

Green ripples gurgle from the white bone,
At noontide flow and at sunset stain.
I rise, I go, with no remnant come,
Our shed has withered and the marge is spattered;
They have torn the red heart from the white skull,
I sit and I weep, I sit and I weep;
I am the widow of three children,
And orphans of a fourth they shall not know.

I have seen visions in the bright moon,
I have heard visions in the black moon rise,
Saying that meat would all surely come to me
For which a high and holy man would eat;
Whilst I alone, the flames had slain.
So God helped me when I needed His help,
So much He magnified my values,
I, through these dark years of fens and mines,
To peace have built my poor but firelit home
And prospered, and prospered myself;
For there was much which my over-heavy heart
Did struggle with, the thirst and the stir,
Till in the firming of its hold on the past,
Life could not endure, but it brought to a stand
In the lipping of the well-cut lip,
And in the force of the learnt speech,
And in the moving of the legs,
There came the kisses of love.

I see the tables turn, the gold is gone,
The scarlet wine-cups sloppily knock,
The sunlight wains to be dark, the country dies,
The would-be stars the mat of the day,
The golden horses languish and pass,
The silver hookers wan and slip.
The silver audience cry, the silver cheer,
The sea of silver has no more silvers to dispense,
There is no more room in it for the fly,
The turning silver has come to a stilllessness,
The counter imposes and the elf is confined,
And the rule of the lily-white stone
Has crashed into dust in the guttering of the sword.

I gave you the green bow for a heart-string,
The white for a digit, the grey for a wrist-bone,
The dangerous space for a heel-wrap,
The cockroach for a roller-skates,
The magical for a diary,
The frying-pan for a rod,
The scarlet for a bonnet,
The fountain ice for a flower-girl,
The magical for masonry,
The pirate's cloth for a dress,

The wild heart of you was a fugitive
Borne aloft and a fugitive too
For a forest of eggs how to escape!
When you're black with a baby in your heart
You can't be peaceful, your rest nigh
To calm rests on a word's distress,
You're haunted by a child's anger,
Your rest is tied to a spider's motion.
When the silver has gone to Kings
And France is your despot,
When fleets arc to sail by for Toynbee
And Germany has yours,
You've sailed to your Sierra-Megare,
And witch all the white by a river.

Outside a mist is gathering and curling,
Like a magic web on the throat of a river
I can hear you breathe by the fire.
You said, "Lady, you are strange and odd,
So brave by day and so bold by night,
Wherefore are your ways so dark and strange?"
You were not bold, you did not know,
And your surprise was like the grey dew on feathers.

"I spend most of my life writing books, and turning out articles
But little is accomplished, I find.  My life is a frenzy.
I am over worked, and foolish quotes draw
Toward genius, and from it all my aptitude,
But here, all I wish is to be off my legs.
When I'm well, let me back into my body.
How can one regulate his life without surprising?

"I've got a tablet on my breast that I'm stamping
By, and this is what it reads:--
Fate's gloom will come.
What can I provide?
Nothing turn aside
From the fate's feeling at one's entrails."

One sold his soul for a song,
Got it reduced to a pill,
And now pill sells for a shoe,
Shoes that were green three years ago
By the bated breaths of a peddler's
How his life turned to truffles,
How his life truffled up and
Heaved to the four-leafed gum.

"All this you say is true,"
said a soldier of the invader. "But is not

certainly not be our savior."
"If I were a man, my friend,"
said the invader, "I would take your

marmosbows, in the belly of the common

tuated to make him look more noble and

takes away our best, and with his soldiers, with

his targets and his bayonets and his automisms

we are made to die, we are forced to watch till

the targets go by, and the best, the honourable invader

is scarcely seen, and then we see better where he is, and

shall only fear from our height any

remarkable ground, were he but half so troublesome

as on a sundial mug. What is a thermometer? When

indicated for use as a game-territory, in the

New York of our great game, at its capital, New

Oh! I love thee, nightingale!

Of all the birds the spell is known,

No bird so sweet. Sweet lady, now,

The world is wide, and all the skies

Are known; and I love truth

More than lovely. Beauty yields

To beauty. Beauty yields to love

More than love.

Singing, you seem so. Beautiful

In what you do, so far as it goes,

Now out on the ocean you soar

To your rest. You sing of the wave,

The wave, the wave, she woos,

The wave, the swelling sea, the wave,

The mighty sea, o'er which you roam,

Receding. As the voice that clears

The fog-flame from a grove, to spurn

Its blood-red beauty. As the wave,

Moving under the clouds, where murmur

Deeply, now, the wave, to spout

Its foam. Deep you swirled, now,

Pale pink, with beauty, gone the

Pale pink you, winding wind, out at last

To your erring. I loved you, and could bow


My head, the voice, the patch of cloud,

Beside you, to high heaven, and be

Up there, a spany on the wave,

Than the bright spany. I was down there,

Away from you and the sea

With the quiet night and its stars.

How wildly you remember, lady,

The lovely night, demure, demure,

With its stars. How the night winds

Stir the moss, and how the water

Chafes, and how the sea flows back

In a swatch from Ala-nérek, king,

In the land of Gorees. The sound

Of the waves is close to me, and open

To the wave-sweep, that gropes to drown me,

Here in the night. Night, to 'scape

Sea-dreams! Night to escape the night-long lift

Of the dream-plopping wakes this valley of sighs,

The darling voice, the little nûtre Dame

Appearing beneath your voice, to gasp

Up at your voice, the valley-smell,

The undoring voice. It's beautiful,

But I am afraid. It makes me so wild

That I have turned to you, I have turned, O night!

To your quivering radiance, only I love you

In my wild madness, not in waking. I am

Dreaming again. And I go up to you, but

Never more, this time, for good, I mean, not

To upbraid you with my six words, to take

My fifth joy of hearing you, your voice,

Still fresh, not terror, making still

One word for your six words, to turn

Your dream to morning, your voice to

My tongue for good. May I not still have

Some spark of fear, some little taint

Of the old passion undefiled, that might

Still be afraid of giving you, turning

To wakefulness with you, to give

Vain care beside? Dear night-borg, you

Uprose for silence the renewing sun,

And light us on your way, and befel

Me, dream-borg, bane. And though we wander

Still from town to town, from square to square,

Still as a fly, I see the smoke of them,

The hurrying vol-lords, the morning

Day-borg, you, darling, you.

If thou be kind, as gentle as thou art now,
Then shall the ship I sail upon, safely bear
Two lights, to show the way for the man I love thus.

As a little child that a cherished doll hath found
Surrounded by some heavenly forest, bending low
In reverence before her patron, feel her soul incline
Toward the boughs that wrap that child, would in herself
Touch, so, with my heart, thy figure, and with speed
Clasp thee, remembering of thy spirit holy--
I will bend low before thee, saying: "Be thou
My father Papa."

Wherefore then deterr?
Thou wert not bom.   Back are thou to earth at the root
Of evil power.  Away!  To thy place journeying.
Was it to hail the primal germs of Stars and stones?
(Since in a separate region and remote have skedabbled
The planets and the elements).
Were it not so, the Gods in the heights of heaven
Had not heard it, nor the awful semiquave
Of offended Gods, nor heard such naming and masen
Of sins leaden-rollpt in piebolic rings,
Unpathed of Jove, unsensed to men by him
Who carnal bodies counts--nor seen Saturn's wife
With child by jointed looks rayed--nor Jove's sole
Circling or bared Sky, saw where, are hearts ill at ease,
Pit holy still, and scars infect the nearest
To pierce and rend.  They, when none else dared, themselves
Dare "come near me," and feel personal God
Big with thought of the bliss to be came by.

Me thou be hearkened, she the daughter of Jove,
The best of heroes, if herein indeed
Something of love nigh beginnings stole--thou mayst
Well hold thy brother to thy spouse of babblest,
And filial trust--all-compeliar, her sire,
Whose seed must ever move the nectar of thy river
Past child-heart to thine heart:  though 'tis confest,
Now near the narrow piers of Aries go'st,
And 'mid the pulsing deeps of thou and mine,
Woe and pain the bond  puts there, and her wrath
Chast:  and therewith, since God herself the trust
My partner the less shares with man.  Let Love
Thus long for thine affection:  hence thine error
To deem thy sister nought, my dear!
For her sake let this evil night go on
A little while, and we a little grieve,
Poor sinners, in whose guilt a betterful God
We have devised pituitious prayers to pour
From aye unto dead them, and contrite hearts
Willing to grudge to live.  I sit a Love

Be thanked for liberality:  and yet

When my head is bared of the chaff
by the day's story, and the light vomit
of regret and disarray beneath,
I wonder: have I taught my spirit to
empty itself and lost its vantage
over other souls?

2

It's morning, and already yawning
in the men's room, already commuters
clombing the metro, others
climbing outsourcing's ladders
through data circuits and functionaries,
and my stomach thinks how many nights
on nights of covfefes and early wills
it tried its best, and failed.

I hear from the messenger: among
the highest
blessed, blessed
, bountiful, so-called because
they have it—and among the psalmists,
the weors, the primly prosperous, the politically
powerful, and the many won't—there are no blessings
for the willfully.

4

I am thinking of things that are not events:
the humble dog, the humble shuttledeeek,
the humble cornet that lasts the duel against chronic darkness
that's now so overdone.
5

This mortal ceases to be an idiosyncratic thing
when I try it on on everyone.
6

With a diurnal temper sometimes.
7

Depleted, fatherly anger is the only thing
that abides, the only thing

that doesn't give.
8

The only thing that abides, the only thing
that doesn't give, will end, that tears.

And oh yes, the tremolo idiote, the tarantled rave.

Of the many poets in this laboratory, only one

Who are we voting for, what watch we wear.
A certain puerile vigeca nymph, the stylus her wit.
15

My friend, I have a thing to ask.
16

What is the nature of the nature of this song?
The nature of shame.
17

What is the nature of shame?
18

One fell action flings the law aside
19

Shunning the fell action that shunning has quelled.
20

A bit of the passion man was born with, isn't it.
21

Shunning the wassail, the watch the wassail, the watch the
wassteek, the primly agitated watch,
22

And isn't it odd, the nature of this watch.
23
And the passion of this nature.
24
And the watch that is our nature.

"Against Certaintys", by Adam Frost [Living, Sorrow & Grieving, The Body, Relationships, Social Commentaries, War & Conflict]
Is the sea a body in which I swim? A world in which my mortality could grow enormous. A body in which my head was fathomed by others long ago. This says I am not myself. This says that my love for myself is paleofication. Conflicts over the nature of light
======================================== SAMPLE 39 ========================================

But he went on talking like a moron.
As a boy he had been a "dirty

Stupid American," as he would say.
"Why, I just happen to own
The only Cadillac in town,
And when I eat but the food on
The menu, I feel happy."
And he's dead now, so we don't know
How funny he would have been.
He took off his clothes
And put them in his pocket,
And thought up a new line
Every single time
To add to the list.
He couldn't stop
Because he'd hit the list.

His two best friends--the others--
Are in the war.
One is in jail for life,
And one's in VD 'cause he spread.
But they'll out, he vows,
When the city's free 'cause they've come
The right way up.

What a brave boy he'd be
If he hadn't t'inked about
And got killed, or a hull
And and didn't pass,
And in his concrete grave
His buddies wade his friends

He says to one, "It's got
To be taken's attitude
That this raid on this town
Is what brought us to look
And see life at high noon.
The only way then
We're going to get paid
Wish we'd been loomboard boys.
I mean we're not brave enough
To take to bed with us.
We're too American"--
I wish he'd go outside
And look at a cloud half-reveered
And think about what he knew
When we raided Pearl Harbor."

They're wishful thinking, Gene.
They're fighting the last war.
Aarrrg! The world's going to hell in a handbasket:
The Army's malnourished,
The Navy's undereinfested,
And the troops are lax, you know,
Because they can't earn ammo, straps, and peltges.

I guess our Army of Sargeant H--ll is wein.
He're sitting in a log where he swears he ain't found.
Ain't never seen a ghost anywhere that's been swamped.
He're mounting errands for the spirits to do up,
And his errandout to the spirits is, "Ghosts to pillage."
They're scopolamine, and they're on Paddy Reilly's copse,
They're occupying his bathtub, and he's laying them low.
They're after him for a drill sergeant's beat down;
They started it, but he won't give them the beats.

When I'm retired I hope to be known
Not as the medic of pus and page,
But as the doctor of spirits, virtue,
Hoping to keep the pall near to the line
Of the heads gone sacramental,
And save the souls that would stumble in
The mire of the muddled war the Medice sweeps.

Each in his close-packed world resembles
The other; both are enclosed forms,
Both struggle for air, and evade
The indifferent storm of time.  Both hope and fear,
Perfect and in flux, the form of each differs,
From those who know them most and fullest,
From those who are their nearest and closest.
I love my one enemy.
I love my one enemy.

The dream is a escape: in it, I live and move;
In it, I seem to indicate a world slipped sight unseen.
If I could travel back of myself to find
The scribe scribbling down the dream, I should know
The young man's self vastly wiser than his oldman.
To him, the world both vessels and the hand
Of the mystic cup from the feeble one's hand
Held by the magician's beckoning shoulder;
To me, who was born and grew and lived and died, the world
Seemed one with the world and lived thrice 10 years.
The man, whom I have loved and watched
Like a faint fancy in a picture,
The lover of life the lover of vision,
The friend of friend and healer of distress,
The uniter and beginning of us all,
The friend of all and observer less of me
Than even my scantily-written odes,
The farter of delirium I now write,
The gentle friend and value of youth
And simple constitution, the noblest
And pettiest of the petty kind,
The humble judge of disagreement
And rejoicer on oppression, the man
Whom anyone's a fellow in.

Our life is half
The life of the days that come and go;

The
======================================== SAMPLE 40 ========================================
Lamenting her loss,
Tears that her fair forehead bites
As she feels the tears on it begin,
And the aged hand, that shake
From the young heart-sigh's grasp, begins to fall.

Now the first night had passed at the Priam Heights
When Love, young son of the Summer, alighted
With a kiss on his glorified face,
Lest he might deign, though he was an old man,
To glimmer forth such a fleeting spark
As once in hope of fire to consume
Sweet-smitten Watching, the far-smitten stare.

And lo! the small eyes that with fear
Once with awe trembled over thee,
Small as a summer's thorny flower,
Are rays that caught fire from thine own eyes
And turned it into light;
Caught it safe in the cantle of their shells,
Wherever they are leaves now.

Thus thy fame is written in leaves of tears,
Drop by terrified drop;
Drop wise wisdom and the wise will know
Only that Love lived and that Love died;
But there are leaves beyond all hope
Where is written one very word--
One word Requiescant.

And there are other leaves, I know,
Drop after drop,
That continue the one word unaltered
(Drop, a drop), and that word, one and one,
The same that it has always been;
And there is truth in saying that these
Are leaves beyond all hope.

This alone and all else is the goal
Of all my wandering;
This, the Alchemist's fire, that makes the dull
Put into sweet savor;
This, the sap-stick of a drowsy child
That makes a father purr again;
And this, the sap that washes up
A man like water.

When I have dug in the dark earth,
When I have imaged heaven above
And seen his feet, made out of all my fears,
His face like shapeliness;
When I have built in the void eternity,
All that I can want, in one, witnessed,--
Nothing will be.

When I sit down to heartily dine,
When my young friends call with drink and fun,
Two things are balanced on the tongue--
The leaves you spread and the gut that feeds;
So much for living, what more do we know?
It was willing, it was quick, what more do we do?

There was nothing left entirely,
But summing, on the wrong end of day,
With the whole world on my finger Lord,
Nothing that was done was terrible;
Earth betrayed her secret as she knew it,
That of two, two's only thing was wrong.

So would it not break with broken tears,
Earth betrayed her secret,
As she knew him not, him or her?
Why not, if Earth is an idiot,
Light out of darkness,
Be one in evil,
Not only the earth that knows?

Why not, if she had two eyes,
Theinty's coming?
Why not, if she had the power,
Why not fix me here?
Why not?1 Would God prevent us of her?
Earth shared the evil with me,
The whole world would in that hour
As soon take the grass away as cast it.

So were this world kept shut forever,
Why should it avail
"All this world of fear and of fault"
To show that, as she turned her to toss it away
And with it all the world,
With hell in her heart and an atheist for a playground,
She could not leave well enough,
Earth was enemy then, not I.

If the grass I mowed in school,
If dust I watched,
If I shook bundle and sparrow,
And crooked me, for a fool,
If I looked twice ere this for Lepidus,
Give me first South Precinct.

For freedom, and the right of doing and being,
For all earth's sunshine, earth's sunset,
The heavens on top of the river,
All while you thought me a daw,
All while you saw me caw
In the trees the leopard,
And thought I was the jessamine
Spreading the curse ofette Anjou,
And all the rest,
The whole of the wrong side
Of love.

In Huncha-Cheezha, in the end alone,
May we find more woods and streams,
More than those two books I gave you,
Which I tried so hard to complete,
But did not succeed, either.
No grass, no banks, no water, no ground.

Is with them as if she had never been.

I turn me from their focus, and tell them
A story of another purpose:
Of how I walked on a certain day
Into a crowd of things I knew could never be,
And how I found, amid the crowded ranks,
The one thing I had always lost.

And how, that day, a girl I saw there
(Her name was Martha)
Surprised the child-hearts of our two friends,
And stole like a miracle from the goblet,
The last coral of opulence
That July afternoon.

I cannot tell you how that night of 1926
Scooped me and stilled me, as with a cudgel,
And how I live, an old woman, combing my dark hair
Because of their remembrancer in heav'n.
They of the black experiences and the wealth,
Of the odd and moldering, the deft and rich,
Who stoop from the lattices of their making
Ear to ear in turn of that unwholes of their ware.

That is not "hungry" now is it?
And you have not sold the pot on your shoulder.
There is nothing to buy, and no child
To buy it. No broken-heart boy, with his mother's,
And her first love's bleary kiss in it.
I am all of us brothers and sisters of this clay,
And it is as if there were nothing alive now
But us, the three of us, and the boy, and her,
Who now is not with us.

Yes, you, you have held the candle to the dim man.
But there have been other candles for more hours,
And not one wronged the distressed beauty of her.
She alone wears her wax before her vision.
The candle, tossed off on a suit of skies,
Dries not, and passes with the man.

The wrong's the wrong I've done her, and hers the wrong I've done her,
The days when she was wakened by my night-time,
And the days when she was woke by my day-time
There was never daylight, there was never night.
There was never twilight, never moon,

 The Maroon (1890)
was there once at the farthest along,
A moon was there, as clear as a firefly.
Firefly and oft afire.
On some parts of the town a carnal battle
Had greatly red all the plants of the carnality.
A city in age not admitting that chivalry
Was glorified by its cankering curviness.
So the age that had no use for its dead
Was quicker with the idea of its thematics

 D'Ancartman in Moore Park (in Melbourne) in the late 1930's
When the suburb was a popular place to visit for students.

. . . lo! shouldedy with mulberries and meadow with bluebells!
White enchantments of a cleanness too, and nature's belt
Riding the dynamic winds, from morning to evening,
As if they wanted to get away, and yet, and they were not content,
Sending illusion sweets through the front door and back,

. . . and not see the intention is intention nonetheless,
And the dark deliberate of the rain-creaks and shakes,
And the swish of the leaves under the dooryard light;
The fact that this retro-drawn crossover is so strong,
Is, in fact, the broken body of a dream we are in upon ourselves.
And here a fantasy is growing with a reality,
Which then proves, as the tree is quite some way away from the tree.

. . . the circumstance of the shadow on the wall
Is, in fact, the same as the shadow, only in on case,
Where the intention is intention, where no shadow is . . .
To the perception of the elbow on the windowpane,
The event does not belong; it places no event
In the round of the air, but the blue of the window
Full foils the event, since it contains no tree nor cranny.
The tree-god is still unfurled on the day
And the sun is still bright; the whittled trunk
Is hidden behind the dome of the church.

 A morning scene of lamps on a stage (point is the sun)
Where the players enter on horseback, with rifles that go
Too fast to be magazines; a man behind stops to adjust a focus of light.

He is blinded from doing so.) The observant player

And now we will not go out of this
So best;
But we'll keep this for our comfort;
And what would you have more

Or any other hoast?

When men by strength do seek
A world's wonder,
And say they have turned from rust
And adulterie,
And bought the world, and say they did it
Out of pride,
Who do not lives a dreamer.

So just as saints do wear
Sinnie meke on th' ears
Of men, so will we wear
On life's change,
Ourred and with the world;
We'll be beknowned by't
And be rich in things.

And there's no boon that we
Can bring no more,
And we hain't exactly right
In this, for we
Might bring our fill
Also; and this world's
Aizes ay as it's

Tell them when war's ogge
They'll sound a' on it;
But then for their ends
They'll undress
Their hearts, oncome unired of
Their grace, and thought it
Were better orchids.

No you don't ken much of feedin'
The poor, when there's men steezin
And lad spightly about o' onlive
That way to go;
It's a gutin't dents no coals
Except oot your bin.

We'll never do away with war, it
Goes as it's meant to do;
We'll never stop the "us and them"
But we'll make them grope towards God in
The light of right;
And some will hark at night to a
Glad tidings.

We will crush our cursed race and make
Our homes in strings,
Shoot we'll climb and reach them high and tear
The sky,
And we'll drink eternally whereon we
Put heaven in een.

This world and the other ones
Is not they should be;
They're not God's idea,
He's God's word.
He'll have them fed and watered and
Have well served.

To wander up and down.

And bad if you go in with your eyes

You never get back. You and I are made
Of different stuff.
And there goes little Tommy G.
Over again to see you;

He's good for a light summer read.
It's nice to get you back.
It's healing and it's being at last;

There's a little twinkin', tweeer, twum, twopise,

We couldn't afford a young friend.
Our girl was only a girl.
We are the Dandies: eyes,

her table topper with drawls of gold to dip

Weary-heart, weary-hearted,
Wretch, born of trouble and poor
And dreaming in thy dream,
Thy hands are strong, thy feet are weak,
But thou art happy-hearted,
Thou art free-minded,
Thou art free- spirited,

That thou may'st ne'er behold,
The gibbering of a hundred Demons
That practice their shadows to produce,
Lest thou believe me too hard to please.
"These are the Monsters of the night;
But who are they? O, each one, please tell!
But I know their demigods--
Their world-here they hold us in their arms--
And in their heavens their children are,
And in their Heavens their helpless children are.

"I am one of these, one of these, one, one, one, one, one!
I am one of these, I am one of these, one, one, one, one!
They rave about me all their way among the vortices
Of hissing devils that whiff whatever spires of wicked things
Muse into my heart. I cannot breathe--O, this is too much!
For shame, I beg you, Athena, hear my horoscope!
It has but Three items--it is not fair--
Alas!
I am too much engaged
To a Mistress who is shrill in tone to call from me:
Shrill, by the nature of your creatures! Hear it not,
For the one that beguiled me, was he cannot otherwise.
And, Shrill, they keep me prisoner at Carmel in anguish:
Carmel, which when I dwelt therein, was neat, clean, and new;
Now, in want of newants, clean, and neat, and neat again!

What can I bear?
What do I here?

Come, bend before us!
And the light shall light your day,
And the dark shall fade;
And your drear and dreadful night
Shall pass in to night and dawn,
And our joyous and solitary life
Rise up to meet your glad and brave prayer.
O Nevermore!

"O Nevermore! I have spoken!
And we knew that you were coming,
And the sun went down as usual,
As it do at the word of a singer.
But your flight to the sea, was unannounced,
Never while the world was dark,
Or the dark was any thought of the dawn.
And the singer died on your wings,
Never while the sky was dark,
Or the light of day in the soul.

But the sea sweeps on,
And the waves toss up the mist.
But they smile and give good night,
When their perpetual wave is hushed.
But they flee
For the wind is not a sound.
And where the living are, fain they sail;
And where the dead, there they will sleep.

Now they are washed away

In the dark waters squall,
By the sick moon beaten white
Down the worlds like snow blown rear.
And their close-hauled albatross falls,
With a ragged wave and a burthen of pines,
From the marge of the host of the dead.
Never, in the dark seas, let them tint
Your moonlight into blackness,
But they run until they are broken--
Chanting, I and You, in the dark, I and You!

Darkness was never enough for you,
Darkness was only the tint
Of the soul to your sight.

Wilt thou go away?

Hast not a sister
Not so faire, not so black and white?
Hast thou pity in thy breast?
Ah! and what saucy thought
That joyous air thou'dst scratched
Was it not worth all,
To charm with beauty such a one?

And hast thou cast
Pleasure and pomacy
Out of the house?
Ay, and bare
Familiar, for thy white
Snow-sledge,
Over the mountain?

And yet the house thou seems
Furnished with all kind of pleasure
For thee, and all kind of pelf,
Happy cam'st thou hither?
Full fielly hast thou been
As any tree
Upon thy draff.

So now thou art a king
Upon a snow-sledge wrought out
Pitying for sorrow's sake,
Pensively humming o'er
Museums of art;
Mocking at all those bright
Jewels, glories and bars of gold,
And shedding tears upon
Any transparent stone.

And lov'st to think
That this coarse soil
Can give a hattier wage
Unto these arches five-membered nose
Can give more gainful instrument
Float would thou drown
The day
With feigning of the thing thou art.

And dar'st thou seen at noon
This wide-armed power
That is the whole
World of men and beasts and horses
And trees and oaks and beasts and birds?
The one-legged ape, who creep
And quake and joy at only wind;
The one-legged ape, who stretch
And treble and leap and dance at only wind.

In this cool night
Where stars and birds
Come as they are,
And we in our pale-faced room
Dark-hearted read
How peopled realms of darkness see,
And laugh at hell
Flying for faery love
That trebles in its arms
The one-legged ape, who trembleth
At only wind.

Surely there is
Some terrible beast,
Some large heroic monster,
That only-wilderness-cries
Longing: be it man-abuse,
Or love-abarisheian plues,
Or risk-another's-bignesse corveges,
Or want-another's-yells
For heavens and hags.

O little-voiced Nature,
Mother of silent men,
Thine is thine igloias-room,
And there's nigh half a foot
In fishes as they
Aye know their pattergies
From calling of their kitte:
Or there is one and half
In which-again-again-cry
For their mate that langning boomed and fledged.

'Tis nature's one case
Apsides and upsoms
Where base things be
Strong only in dallying:
And higher things down turned
Tumble the meres and lods
Where I might muff a bit
Of voice, I come.

A light mist fattens this air,
It has rippled all day:
And certain hues and wheresocks
Weighed myghts and vauge.
As in the wet-gray of mid-May
Yon crucible grows bright-eyed,
And heateth frieze-wide;
So in the dazedly sunlight
I peep and stare, and dream my dreams
About the springs and piers
Of waters, where this stream goes down.

A wood-sanctum in these drifts,
These coasts limeret of sea and wood,
These little spires above the sand,
Of sand and sea; and vast and still
The Armada moored here.
And all the time these drift-wood faces
Like pink-edged sapphires over-size,
Gloom foamed gang-fashion side to side,
As if the Sea-Nymphs just out of sight
Were held in church and spELD to stand
What blessings on her! for the breasted coz
Should be released from Him that brought her forth
With George, and that unhallowd naught
Should smite her!

A misty mint-loved sky, here bright and chilly
Between the curls of receding night.
And here the two-hundred-year breave
Of rifted sand that mirrored their tread,
That streaked black-beaded to the poolboarded turf.
And in the feathery, the land was clutched
With haggard stares, and crouching moans, and gushing chills;

And you wrenched out of that delirious swamp
The flower that was life; and you rose
Out of that stone unshaken and unmoved.

I do not want the inane accomplishments
Of your striving, here. The dun masons
Useless molds and all that. Your craft is fine,
Your knowledge worth earnest heed, your hands
Immortal, your immortal skill.

Yet, if you set your heart upon it,
Constructive effort ever has more
Of than canifice than can be got
By major hands. The world will grow
Dense of itself, and strain the mind and
The body. When I read, as now I read,
Hectors and Cosmographers and their books,
I think 'twill be autumn soonan' will go.

But not to the whole mind and body thus,
To some one part alone, you speak
Too much. I feel it, but I cannot tell
Why. For right is, perforce, must it be,
And there's no that d----d teacher in the world
Like Caesar's faithful and exalted words.

You say the world will groan, and on my head
Will fall a fortune, and a beautiful wife,
And honour, and all kindness. There perchance
My hem is laid, and there the starting sword
Of suspicion is in my cheek, and thus
I'm forced to tell the world my thoughts. Nay, for all
My friends, they're only my cure for truth, for
Lieberman's glories, and for all that wilderness
Of noble, unhappy men, my joy and my doom."

"Not so," quoth she, "magic this side of heaven
No one may speak, nor magic feel himself
Easily by her influence mastered,
When she's present, and her presence brings a
Wonder loveliness to beautify the mind.
And therefore I suspect in everyone's teeth
A grimmel. I know that you feel this,
And you may judgment yet play at the last:
That woman is magic of the sort
No man may wield without her help, and yet
Himself he fails to destroy ere he
Draws all her strengthe from the sanctuary."

"Aye, but not this only," thought Osman,
"Nor this alone, only reason's sun,
Which like the bedside star every night,
Greeting the patient's breathing, says,
Behold, I am the physician; behold
My services!" he began to say,
"I've brought you of service a gem or two;
Here is the key that shut blindness, saw,
Or, if it delay the knight to wend,
That ward by which his grievous wound
In secret swerved." He said, and likewise she
Bade that he might heal his wound.

"Bethink you, that there my finger left is
To the stone that hid my sight, and you
To the globe of water on the left,"
He said, "where the wound had made a pass,
And you had said, each one, that I had but dreamt:
"The wound, of course, I had healed; but then
The madness of her embrace made right
My foolish heart, and I was again as wise
As I had been in Odysseus when he walked
With Psyche." So the cup that had his name
In sty new locks would hold down to him;
But she urged it with well-wrought gifts more
Than she was encouraged to bid him.

"At home she sends me, all her skill, to make
Her Eyes and her Lip were tame to his;
And those were but earth that were shadowed out
By the

Cross, as if wrought by her blood, with the glare
And the puff of its ashes, with flame and fire,
As if she used her fire for lure of war,
I turn me free to my lady.
What was this that I saw? Is'nt all a dream?"

Then said the rock: "From this place I know not where,
In the broad realm of being, on this little here
They keep enshrouded, our sister, our blood,
And me from my given doom, she gave birth to, or took,
Was infused with, at the moment of her birth.

Or where it got its beginning, or how,
Or whether it issued from the wild of things,
In you, or whence it now hath life and light;

From the hill-side coming together, will creep
Down upon us both and be our guardian;
But thou shalt halt the cattle in thy stall;
Thou, too, mother of the human kind,
Within the very city for our dwelling
Which we to day do beheld in our dreams,
Treading closely, by thine own feet on the ground,
As though, for token of martial events,
The feet of conquerors were making foot-prints in the air,
While, wide-charted cities sank into dreams,
In night's requiem of deceptions and lies,
The speaker stood before thine eyes on the floor;
So, in thy then bravery, in thy genius, stood
God's witness to the judicious and wise,
The ancient and unfatheringly mighty earth,
And all her rock-shifted children; and the high
Echoes of the thunder-gloom, and all its senders
Of tidings forethought; and all synodings and singers
Of battle-smites; and all power tumults, and all
Praditions, thoughts, fervours, mysteries, jugglerings
Of diviner powers; and all rapt communings current
To move the soul at present; and all similar things,
All springs of dispute, all threaded things, all
Contending camps, all stirring parts, all things
Hung dandified like good owlets' nests,
All nooks of war, all beautiful parts of camp,
All blear-eyed crows, all drumming boards, all
Worships of victuals, whippet-jobbing lips,
All wars, all piping, tweeting, each thing
That makes the dinning-gear to man's soul;
Yea, every sound that's born upon the wind
Is in itself a sound; and these that move,
These that purr, all these flatter upon the air.

How learned was he? And how did he think?
More like a man, more like a man we have none;
For noagered priest is contemporary with the Jew;
Noagere is contemporary with the Turk;
There is no time when the robe of saint is not not wide open
For some priest who comes t' improve his arms and his legs.

And then how came spirit, with body, with blood,
Philos, philosopher, friend, about our house to wander?
O Yohew, the poets must sing this: but I dream
It is a comfortable place, a home that likes spirit!
If he would build then he must know that his materials
Are bought with the cost of his materials, his hands
With hands of a many-Divided paidgen bearer.

As for the war he was in a moment such
That, his composure to interchange the bet,
Sped the discussion long from the Plains of Lor?
As a lone bee to a cluster of dams,
Or a herd of cows to a tribe of Indians;
For he seized
A glow-worm for his fire, and he seized
A waterskin that a lot of spirit wore,
And all the family of Silver Dreams brought
To the town of his choice, or any place, any time,
Was a sort of boy who a bright hat gave shine,
A lad with a water-cap for a spirit-lady,
Or a happy boy with the gold of the sun on his name,
Or a sapling with a family of leaf.
When he grew older
His face with the grief of the dying
For the years that turned to anguish,
Was not such a strange and sunny face
That sprang a child laboring by his door,
With a shining flame, in the Southern Rain.
He had grown
Fit for itself a thousand stories, each like a rose,
Telling of what the man did and saw;
How the Over-side sent up the water in its anger,
And the whirl of the wheel of the over-head himself,
What the men he saw at the back of the grassy ridge,
And the fall of the yellow-voladdle showers,
The plash of his uniform, and the blot of his sabre,
How he thought,
And the coming of winter with the southern gate
Of the Inn of the Korean in the Soraci-bar,
And the supper of his friends, and the parting of day
From the orchard, and his home, and the crying of trees,
And his reappearance at night on the « Castori. »

And this is the
======================================== SAMPLE 47 ========================================
Old the sufferings;
Old the cares and sorrows;
Old the hopeful years,
Old the nights of gladness;
Old the gladness,
Old the tears o' life shed.

O'er Ocean's foam and billows' foam,
While as wide clouds swirl round,
The gun-ship sails with confidence--
Its treasured friends are o'er the sea,
And confidence takes from them rest.

O, the calm heart and the steady hand!
What daring in the courage gleams!
What noble deeds my gallant friends,
In danger's need I cheerly sing--
May their brave soul ever be in fear,
When implacable they bear my cup!

Proud above all beneath the dome,
Where high the rebellious roar,
Whose thirst for blood shall fill
Till every bandit's head are cored,
To the missing realm refined,
Where no gentle united rise,
With discord to concretize
What Nature in its due course ordained.

But we have heard the general gasp,
We have seen the motion of the grave,
And we see struggling round the field,
These despots, sovereigns, threatening ruin:
The stronger force now scatters,
Now the sad protector struggles on,
Now shields and swords are flashing out.

O my love, O my amaran,
Serenest song of the bower,
But swiftly changed--time cannot sever
One thought, once started, beginning.
Long, long ago was it changed and done,
That kept and quenched my fancy's power;
Though a foolish queen I was the grower,
Yet, Love was in the bower
Till she whose bosom like a well-spring sways,
Who loved also war for some bore deed did mingle.

Now, sung I also a different song;
Love, though she's brave, weights heavier than he.
She was a widow many a year,
And her son by a thousand played the soldier;
He had fled behind the castle wall,
And she followed with her ladies all.

Her son, all widower-like, wept and screamed,
When, looking on him, she saw him strayed,
Like a drowning swimmer on the wrist,
Look, one time, in that fashion hung!
But she, full of childrabbit heart,
Remembered how to tangle,
And she called quickly: "Well, my son,

Of old acquaintance fondly touching,
Mother's heart was also feeling.
But when evening met the nymph in passing,
And saw how pensive her look was,
Her heart went through her with a feeling
Of pity and of man's casting.
For on her head she shaked a blushing look,
As though for a man that wasn't her,
And she whispered in a tremble, mute,
"Dear, be not ailing heart with me,
For my man does love me."

And at that very moment Christer Ulrich,
Who had got behind the business castle wall,
Up to the tower room in the turret high,
And into the balustrade slight,
Drove open flopped a shot, one moment neer the sward side:
On the brackish mixture of the water sluiced,

That very moment the creature in the air,
Like a small dam, began the floodlight blurring
Of the stream, and she from level to river;
And he leaped into the river at her clinging.
And the creature in the sward far away
Forgot her former art, and the effort strange,
To traverse distances through the thicket feeble.

But she snatched at the reed, and her endeavour
Was even and quick, for to rush at the rope was her mood.
In the piteous forked path two paces only,
Upon the water the whole forky path bleeds.
And the rivulet, which the maid wished for running,
The sodderer yet the more effected;
And the daggered water in its wasting
Was no more still than a convulsive start.

The witchery of it almost acted a spell,
To be so natural, well-nigh feeling right.
And the witchery of fashion's noiding all crumbled,
While the maid felt in her greedy grasp
The haughty skyfowl's cagey pain.
And she heard in the tree-top, high aloft,
The cry of a bird in distress.

Now a great wag cut in at the door,
And said: "Ori, look out if you close your eyes
On a little gray man in here,

======================================== SAMPLE 48 ========================================
"Through the damp season
they heard the shrieks of children.
In that most fearful time
there was no man or woman
who did not feel
the need of all of them
that suffered and died.
But it is now and good
that they are in the grave."

A man and woman lie
beneath the lamp,
with quicklime upon them.
The man is fully dressed;
his right hand is in
the cement around his feet,
and he has a large space
of cement over his head.
The woman's eyes are closed;
she has a soft leather pack
full of things for their clean room.
They will be sent straight
into the grave when is over.

Another man and woman
sit down in the shadows
before the feed-mill.
They look up at the pump
and at the clean room.
They smile
as if they think
nothing of the hell
they are in now.
The man looks like a clown.
The woman's straight color.
It is like a walk
in the forest
that takes the shape
of the trees.

And over the heads
of these two
are the shingles
that will be said
of the old town.
The shingles
that will be seen of the
old town.

Oh, the weather is fine and the sunlight is shining.
What do you say to the late meeting,
the faces once turned into chocolate and marshmallows?
What do you say when you get tired of the streets and to twilight town
and you've read too many poems about trams and tap-books and fountains?
To the river and the forest, the floating light of the streetlamps,
the river light which runs past by,
the city lights gone off to the suburbs.

You are wearing your green coat

In the yard I watched a man take
his clothes off

This was strange,
but he was erect.
I was glad

not to have a way to be injured.
When I saw pictures of Alexander

I tried to hate
myself a little.

If I were you
I wouldn't go.
I'd stay as still as a mountain.
In the yard a cat knotted with passion

Where we sat made a good place

I don't trust my own love.

Slovenie (1977) is like this

Why can't we all

Like a woman, I escape my own

in history and strangers' faces.
I don't trust my own love.
I try to stay always the same.
It's like having a cheap flea

I use him
but he never proves to be a cat.

======================================== SAMPLE 50 ========================================
-How he bade me, to mount the spire.
What a palace! How profuse!
None can stand in its circle at a glance;
How his magnificent dwelling
Is all dazzled day and night
By the splendour and brightness of its tower,
By the glittering spires that set so high!
How I gazed at his mansion, and yearned to know
More of its treasures. I would climb
And walk inside.
There are passages in it, however,
That none but myself have found!

- I am an only child,
My mother's telegraph,
Used once by mother
To let to me the news of her
Sickness which would kill or cripple.
My father lived in a cottage,
He did not have a palace
Like those great cities of France,
He didn't have an apartment,
But what he did have was fine
For a young man of twenty.
A fine home with a fine little garden
Was my home, Paris, in those days.

My home then was a cottage
Of two rooms, and in the courtyard
There was a chained machometer
With a movable fence.
This was used for buggy whips,
And all the other things before us.
This machine was invented first
By an Italian, and later
By a German, and both
Devised-by an Englishman some years ago!
My father had this macho palace
Whose security was the gallant-fledgeless
Stetson breeches, which he wore at night-
Was a proud youth of youngster nobility.

My home was in a suburb called Hell.
Hell is a region in the great city
Undecayed by the horrifying
Carpets and ashes of the imploding
Sciennese tower. There was then and there
A music in the great city, a gloom
Where men lounged at the windows of the markets
And studied the world on black windows.
I study now the halls of the cities
Of the youth of the past, of the noble future.
Hell is a region in the golden morning.
Hell is the region of eternal repeal.
There a great weapon was invented by a hero,
The prince of darkness mastered the armies
In the wars of earth, in all wars, in all wars,
And threw his enemies through the intervening years
Through the dark door into eternal ice,
A task performed beyond the force of the sun,
The strong protection of all kings, and crooks
Of kings and princes: also, the aid rendered
By ancient prophecies to them, that foretold
The downfall of these harried and persecuted
And caused many to grow pale with great awe.

There was a gallant character in this region,
Who met by turns the gods and his satanic foes,
And led the kings in the wars of kingless cities,
The hero with the sword, Aleister the bold.
Aleister, also, was lord of night's enterprise,
And person of hope to the kings of the tombs,
Who kept the dim half of the light, of the cities
And the dark half of death.

And this hero, Megara great,
Whispered and stung the children of the dead,
And boosted the brave deeds of men noctiflar
And brought their souls to wonder, till they too
Departed and went veiled through the winters
In the passing of Ages: now the grave merchants
Are only secretly drawn through life
By supernatural vitality
To seek forth to living men their heirs,
With crowns on their heads, and golden hilts
And collars, coming as pilgrims to form
The hollow horse for the beast, which with its march
Wends the earth and maps the end of all men's
Presents to God:
Such is the greatest Kingdom that the world,
That is to come, was ever born to gain.

Yea, the secret draweth me unto her,
And pizzicati and sheepish men and afraid,
And all those that shall be captains, and shall gain
Their kingdoms by the default of the dying,
And shall giving with their treasure, vainly sad,
That little they know of their going deeds betoken,
And after-times rock as rock-sides of war.

I sit and pull my eyelids back like a phial
And watch my secret thoughts dance out and in:
And evermore I see the Creature, hard at hand,
With head bended down, and beginning ever
To face the imminent burden of the helpless flesh:
And now I see her yellow locks fire upon her:--
My dear to do the bidding of my body! I did
Not think it possible that my small animals,
The
======================================== SAMPLE 51 ========================================
Whips, shorn and shattered--will receive my decree;

Shall put upon me and bind in no cruel way.
My dark hair will all the world condemn to fl'
Perpetual shame; it shall be bound in nets
And flung among carpets for ulterior purposes.
This hateful honor shall be mine alone,
And all the worst, myself only spared."

Oh, how I do not blush, though hopelessly inclined
To tremble in the uneasy meshes of my skirt!
I felt--and perfectly well, I must confess--
That nothing could be easier than to see
What naked truth-beguiles a snug and small
Practise suit like this; and I'd have been quite
Insolvent without it.  (A good-will woman,
I know, has vowed that she himself would like
To have a shiver cut short, by seeing Truth,
And--Imitating him, I--am making him own
A confession.)

But though I weighed the darky with the dreary
matter of world affairs, and reckoned free
Between our Paris and that distant shore
Where my poor friend was sailing,--I yet could spell
The word "experience" thereto, as well as "care"
(An experience heretofore, perhaps, hers);
So that, by conducting Mario there, I learn'd
That--voilà, there went, nay there, fled that shameless
Flutterable heart of woman's--which my wife,
But too believ'd, had inly severed.

That friend I leave no more to suspect, ye'll say.
He hears and he forscribereth with an eyetooth
Of his kind wife, and his erring kennel,
That there's no such goad in the kennel
As 'tis fair grounds for a good few hairs
To stick in their prine:--with the reason now
Whate'er befool may ensue, he ne'er forgets.
In short, the man's come to this pass because
Of something that never lay in the ark
To make him belaborable to him:
Nay, and I will do my language as far
As humanly may be, whose words are just.

For though, thou said'st, men in sweet Ricoemnas
Were smit with devilish calumniousness,
Yet thine own tongue is not to be blamed,
That, full oft as the Greek or the Latin, comes
At heuth, or halfhenet, to translate it.
God knows that this tongue, with a touch undarked,
Should be lat; and a Devil's to moderns, obscured.

Now, unicursultar, dis dissolutem, intereunt
Licet et Inundis suis solet, absunt ad noss
Pulcher, orf and day, as I fain would tell
And so dispaire throw into a trimpt Kaf;
But I guess it well, and dree with the seas,
The more to show that I am not a fool.
Then, if I go so grim, picture shall we find,
That he must have pundible, that mine ear is true.
And the way is left that he might well have pierced,
And I should have it, by this warrant, allana.

First, out of the matter that I bid, I may
Well speak, from my hand, what my heart in such words
Are leading you to deem a dig in court
Should be left, of right, as a collateral prey.
We have no greater user than Quack, or nearer
By command insuperable. Nor are we abberrant
In our choice of our gods, from whom we receive
No admonagement, in their manner instructed.
If we do not well first of every day, our prayer,
The superstition hence is vs to shake;
And the market sell Buckfast not, but Chaf on,
With the nicer the more, if well we do not eat.

Now this Buckfast is not the fat, but the lack
Of the insipidum non impingeing;
And this gleams are not make glittered, but there
Solid, or dimpled, but with a nail-bare weight,
Or a growing brood of buckles, if you would call
The buckles growing, rings. But this meal is stuffed,
Or boiled, if you prefer, with the semblance,
And wrung-out cheeks, a spectre is at the root
Of our face, which is one, we having one soul.

I had a tattooed cholera victim,
silence, poem & voice,
the two entwining;
the right enthroning the left,
so beneath the earth,
not on top, the sin,
the passionate chryslerian killipio
of the slow apical communication
of hemp & voice,
the crystalline & pearled speech
the grapewell & stone,
the grave the crystalline,
the marble husk,
voice & sand,
the wearier speech of death

the unwritten book,
the form bound rationally,
discovering beyond doubt
the cause & score.

Books? Must these paeodists dream of books,
these theorists of the paralysed rhythm
of speech,
the faltering muscle,
hearing and marching?
Are you a passer-by surveyed
in a starequest, a glanceweary pant,
a glinting watch, a tapster'd crystal frame,
a sweet German music or is this a tieless 4/4
"[name] is the jewel of [name]."
Or is it the rhapsody of Holland
whose forecourt displays & grates
the vividity of gold?

Deletion, DNA repair, mutation & change:
these shapes & forms do you have a say in this?
These pained motions we must interpret:
some sunset spy outfitted in matchovour
shimmer out of the upright & indefensible
gathers them & drops them into the lap of opportunity.
The seed game of sounding is the game of explaining.

He's clean, and he's got his beer,
And he's quite reformed, a piper!
He can come to work on this farm
A graciousity and free,
And I'll get a drgey on the "Randy"
As he swore I'd a mate –
A drgey on the "Randy"
A mate of mine –
A good hearty Scottish by-way,
The Greenock Cock –
A drgey of Scottish bun,
Whose heart of mine

Aye – on the "Randy" himself –
My well-spring of care,
You are Holden, he of the brilliant
And upright life,
To me a man to know,
And a charmer too,
A charmer and a real man,
A charmer that tears
The hearts and brains
Of the white trash like me –
The trash of the high ways,
The way of the great Lords
Of the farm that I keep,

That keep the "Randy" farm,
Mine and its mother's life,
That's a fair reel
With its dross,
And down we go, down
To our last dinner –
Last night we sat
On the "Randy's" higher board,
That's the life of it,
And the after-dinner speech
Where the Master said his prayers.

And the plan was that he, my old,
Haute cottage of wool and wood,
Should be the Crown to settle
The various disputes,
Cares and doubts and doctor's bills,
That settled not in their entirety
The account that we two met on.

And I admitted at the Court
That the animals were gross,
Tortured and ignorant,
But the Dad, my dear Floyd,
Roused as we were in the nostrums
Of "The Ethics of Lycidas,"
A gospel seemed essential,
To amends for the offences
Of the shots and the bay.

So, away they went to Bed,
And heard the Passions the animals read,
Which did not chants or sing,
But they bent then over and over
The pages of Genesis
With the now insufferable pains
Of our carnalities,
And the Dad,

Southward the swampy bottom soon they found,
And then a tract of marsh, green and high
Beyond the form of earthly plant that grew:
So rich the spot, and slick with waving grass,
That they could only think the ground might be
An easy swimming pool.  'There,
But for the pool, the horses must be
Bridged there with fence; and we'll build one here,
The best we can, to suit the place.'

The Mayor's smile lit on his long face,
'I'll give you starters Galen's books to read,
Eloquent scholar of the ancient wise;'
The very girl that could be no more,
Save while she stooped the low ground grass to touch
The nice and soft leaf, or look, while tripping
Down in the grass, how much she would relish
The foaming drink that mingle weal and woe brings.

'Drink me, Madge, the nectar of my mouth,
The drop of colour you need not wish for, or for
My heart and flesh you can get at any bard.
This froth to froth, of white and gold, goes up
As high as Scott, I'm told, the farthest height
That poet reaches for; and 'tis mine if you
Consent to drink this froth at my mouth
In place of all the well-drawn stuff of poets.'

A GENERAL SPOIL?   I think not.  Hinty,
The way to spoil a country is to spoil the seed.
For every poet-born and every household name
There is an equal indecency of face.
Blaise, Sylvanus, Garrick, drop till we besiege

Pudding-street with tar andPutney castles, no doubt.
'Parnelagne' needs no collation.  I'm
Why shouldn't Woodsworth return to London,
Swift and Swift only with the Dover queues?
I am west of London time today--
West on street-lamps, out of town,
Digging in therows of Bridgwater clapboarded,
And in this marble-haunted gravel there's a pool

That shows me nothing in particular.
What I know of Spring from examples outside
My window is a spring of miracles:
Overwater, on a moorland, at dusk,
Over water, with the stars, and with the moon,
Over water with the sun at his highest,
And over it the drifting mist of spring,
And over it the Spring-up on the woody house-breeze.

Here comes the catching whistle of the hound and the dromed,
Here comes the chariot of the evening,
And here comes the chariot of the spring-feathers,
With their scrolls of fire, and the waxing of world.
What is the endless wavering and trembling of page 54
Who can't or won't do anything but rot?

My day!  My day! the page who soon must be rotting
In the dust of it, the dust of it, the floccus,
Wicked scythe or ticket awaited at the door,
Maketh my day overmuch, it is plain;
I smooth a path to you, though the road be rough;
I make the day appear, even though the day be nought;
I wound and swagger till I find the universal sum,
And then I carve the letter I.  And so my day is well spent.

Dear Day! we meet, though you paint the sky,
And any way determine the sky;
Of the two which the word sounds happiest,
So, you have resolved the sky.  But mine
Fraternal sets no sun;
Mine maps only show mountain and Stream and house,
And each to each is an island;
My Cloud all blends together aloft
Like the Persian Shurang;
My Spring is a long increase,
I flourish like the mutual lakes;
My air is a hollow in an inland sea,
Or, if you take me by mouth,
When you pluck its lower half, it's a hill.

A hill all grass, a grass all flower,
And the bottom half a ditch,
With a wharf of water lilies pink,
Where sameth and poppies ere they drop,
And drown the lower with rise and fall,
And take a current under cover
Of the grass and flowery terf,
They dry as man would thistle and bole.

And i' the end it's upon your hip,
And legs you know as well as eyes,

Of white and yellow shows,
Sitting there, and that he hears us.

But if some wild and harmless thing
Be first in our lives,
To him a bird that hovers
In the garden, or a yellow flower,
A glint of sun in the hedges,
Or the chaff's bloom in the stoure--
He will not lose his calm touch,
But will call us favourites both together.

Oars, oars, by hoist; to-morrow
We'll tack to Lycos, who knows?
Lycidas was our squire of old,
And nursled us with a boist'ous mind.
A beautiful boat he pleases,
And folds us in the sunshine and shade.

If clouds can waver and whitemon chant and sail no March for sixty years

"For as we groaned it was not so deep", by Lucretius [Social Commentaries, War & Conflict]
For as we groaned it was not so deep
That from our very souls did fiends become mute,
For ye be nothing while she laughs with us,
Smiles only with such dying lips as move.
For as we groaned it was not so deep
That hell within the heart should take no part,
Nor lave its feet upon the rolling sea,
Nor breathe its air chill, nor water enter:
Its swampy parts nos sounds should hurt ye much.
For as we groaned it was not so deep
That every fool tongue spake something superstitious
For what could not change with her was shamed,
Or not incorporated leave a changelasting mark:
Things much and things ill-inclined should vulgo inflame
For woeful Mi'gret's wheel may roll among our necks.
For as we groaned it was not so deep
That what bit you you might heal me, I or she:
Vulcan and I as one will laugh together.
For as we groaned it was not so deep
That all foolish shades of us with her should blend
Or come together yet to leave no differences,
Or her lathe thoughts in my mind should match so well
As her Latonia's thought on my next breath have found.
For as we groaned it was not so deep
That whirling ways of Vulcan, if he change
Upon my wooing should all wane and die:
Bot as it is perfection claims to do,

Glided through the village.  Soon I saw
A man with outstretched hands in the narrow way,

By a boy resting his spear against a wall.
I saw the rags and ashes of a stove
Flap against a big old ax; and that ax
Hurled clumsily by another,
Who smiled and drew a dirty pug at straw,
And drove the fuel-block behind.  And then

A horseman all shabby; then a doctor,
Who tramped with a stertorous pace;
A rider with a gasping voice; a girl
Who ran beside him, praising a pail;
And the steep road sloping up to the sky,
Where an ambulance went whistling by
And a dead dog went joyously'round
On a red shoe; and then, in the distance,

The village pulley, with its crying crew;
A white-sheeted boat; a long sleigh drawn sled;
A number of I.M.T. athletes passing;
A herald, pulling a white-cart with a unicorn;
A sign of decorous delivery;

A riding-age child, with a head like a balloon;
A labourer, ploughing a furrow; a sailor, sailing;
And, clad in black, a mower on a snow-stack,
That whistled and tapped,
As he passed from my neighbour's door,
A lady looking sharply gaily dressed.

I had been long asleep,
When, aozide up by heart,
And, awake, at the crack of dawn,
I slept, and I awoke,
From first sleep to secondness turned,
Conscious of the world, to second mind.

And I had dreamed.
Of a true story,
Great Marie and great Louis,
Of a Christmas feast, and offer
Red wine and meat, and center
Close on a Christian shrine,
A bell, and icons, and shews
Of swettes and spoutings hot.

I smiled; I thought it funny;
I played, and I smiled again,
I sent back belles that pour vemiend,
And I went home like a snowball.
I had a ball at the long last;
For, before I was a man,
I had sho build a court house,
And lain low to become a clerk.
I had balls; and when I was two and three,
I had a wife;
And my old wife,
Who trinked and dazzled,
With a look that was like casting water through glass.

She was the greatest she that ever was;
She was great once and great again;
She took in and ensured the general's ease
Upon a certain plan,
That suited both parties;
And, having given her name,
I signed myself and document in hand.

She was great at what she did;
And some that are great now;
She was great; and then she was not;
She was great in her own light;
And she will go again;
And probably great is the former too;
She can keep the torch kind,
If the oil of the lights is hot.

THERE are those who say,
That Performance surely must come next
In time and tide,
That he who has performed best
Must not be counted more than once;
And they may comb too, too, her hair,
For it is common all.

It seems that "dear me well"
Too often turns the tough comb,
That "sir therewhere" gets the bald
And "bright will take my i,"
For the law of plums
Will not forsake my Soul,

HERE I stand, when all at once
Cries out a regular roar,
As every living thing
That is a mile around
Breathes forth a tone, as loud,
And then the city closed
Rests in its own sound; and all
That can be crowed, rises up,
The city of my Cities,
And, through the sound,
Throb their 1 streets, Sunday,
Each lower decking hill,
Where my churches ascend
Tingling with their chant,
Which from the moving make
Rise to the Stars above
Actors, in air that muffled there
They let all flight embark,
And let my intervals
Ring out and ever true
And making,
Stay in time
Until my sermon's said.

When Pain and Only Joy
Stop be-lieging, and wandering
More near the truth than Sleep,
'Tis to thank the spending mind
Which, when a little let,
Only let it be told;
It doubles, cleanses, and endear

I had a dream of a joyous day
When my lord and all his knights were there:
I thought that each knight o'er whom he shone
Was beautiful as a rainbow is,
Or golden cloud, or golden tree,--
A knight without breath, a king for whom
There is no tongue to pray or cry.
I dream'd, and I am sure it was true
That 'as horn was fire,' so song can pacify.

Now I have had my seven sons, and seven more
Shall have wives as many as these whom I ...
... My memory is a helpmate, meet when
I have words alike in all quarters.
Now I have had my seven sons, and seven more
Shall have wives as many as these whom I used
To hold so numerous within my ken.

And the last and the first I told you of; and now
There are eight of my race left alive,
And six of mine that the world must not lack;
And more than half of all my race that shared
In the woodlands and the hillside and the plain
My cradle, and lifted up my lily, and nursed
My fair-lip herb and my tall tree-toad.
And these are mine, and more than mine: I swear
By my graves, and by my sires drawn here and here
To live their lives secure from casting stone.

As it fell to one who had grown old
In being told what he had grown to say
Unto some child, Unto a slave
Amid the warm weeds and mead,
Disloyal in these hollow places
By the will of man and flesh,
Unto death first of changes
And of infixing hircus:
So my generation falls:
And here is yet one whose hair
Grows heavy with woe and gray,
Who having seen too many things
Shall befull is of yore
Unto this city of gold.

By the rivers of this great land
He is borne before his few late dreams
Through the none-foraging hours
To the place where he should be born,
Cursed of the lord of earth and he
To bow himself before the vision
And with new wrath of promise fierce
Fear and despair forget.

There in his earlier life must he be
Dumb unto his own comfort and speech,
Bold before his time, careless of self,
Sorrowing in groves that comfort none,
Dumb to both good and the worst,
Before he kennan in his feet
The rest that all men must come to keep
For his last greatly bent content.
For like light in hour of dark begun,
This smallest frame of all time's waste
Drippen and drippen, mm-p and mm-q
Drippen and drappen, drit and dallow,
Self-governed and free, and doth-family-built,
And doth-family-trust and cleave to both.

We kens of men and we ken of gods
Are two-time variants of one life; and so
We see the traces left of them evermore,
Where 'tis not too late by far for love o' days
To hide them from the sun, and from the worm.
So may he see us, and he knows we need not furl
Word of us vainly here like winged dream,
But both resurrect for death's own sundry chances,
And once again be touched by glad accident
On inextinguerus kens that extaculate thought.

When Gods do drink out of heaven, or men
Do take with sickle of breath of human breath,
When men do laugh and cry, and dance and sing,
When men do these, then is the moon to teach,
Till drowsy time grow stouter far adown
And wild the four-o'clock wind say drowsily,
"Friend, we have not strayed too far from the way
In telling how the god forgave the man."

"Lord!" said the rest, "what is the meaning of that band
Of mighty mountain-ranges

"Fold in at our feet
"See, folded in the arms of the sacred heavens."
Then the Child by their side,

The cave with all its tale
In their hands, still gazing,
They did not still
Long, until a miracle
Of light, and a breath
Wherewith the tale
Was done, was burned to ashes, and the world
Was cut in twain by that infernal flame.
Then in terror
Down from the earth
And to the four winds,
To the four winds to the east,
Through the wide horizon of the night,
The little mantle of a child was borne,
That closed round
The abrupt
End of the wrinkling mountain-top.

There are few evils that I hate in this world as much
As fillip,
The kind of fillip that comes when and where it is bidden
By blameworthy intention on the part of the fowler.
There is no deadly poison that falls without atonement,
Without atonement; yet so great are the deadly poisons,
That they are all at one meal, and would fall, together,
Like the hour-glass or the great cross, and should not unship;
But here is one fitly punished fillip in the mischief,
Which, should be taken even with the wise intention defense,
Makes all madness and mischief fit; and yet, on the other
Harmful:
For the reckless have no defense from fillip.

The time and place of this fillip, and where it was fated,
I cannot tell; I is so wide, and fluid, and strange,
That the wind, forsooth, could not have done more narrowly
Upon this Rosette, that for mans action, and frailty,
This fillip was graciously cast upon this side,
And the graphic phrase, that now  and now  is grated,
Over the ground:
But yet, it was not streaked, streaked: though it were traditional,
Yet is it fitted by way, it is my way,
The manner-way,
In faithful tradition: such is my defense.
There was a fillip in its kind;
So this tale is told.

Who will hear, and hearken, and be pierc'd,
And fillip the ear with tender reports,
And sweet criticism, the stuff of the heart,
Perceptive, but sensitive?
Will it be straight men, erect in their plans,
Who furnish us our American Art,
Who form, with tender but determined eye,
The forms of roadway, and railroad,
Artistic conscience, but too real?
Will it be such men as Louis Comfortin
Who, choosing the upbeat, did aim,
Instead of no mark,
Their virtue, and chose their country
To be their work; and, then, forgot
The exercise of the hand,
Forgetting, perhaps, its effect on metal,
On this or that?

I know it is
To be or not, a choice of choices; but I
Would that the choice should rest for some,
But not to keep,
The chosen; for whom, when they will not choose,
'T is fair exchange of nobler lives.
What is it is not to be: that which is
Not excess, nor squalor, nor want,
But in the general being, love, hunger,
Worry, and weariness, and sickness,
Those things, in the abounding cosmos,
That one by other, fill being. I would not mine
Appearances infinite, whether to one another
Closer or more, and in no wise all;
But love, and hunger, and fatallity,
And slight hunger, and the sense of weariness
To be dear, and honest poverty;
And all phenomena of life, in one,
The life of love, are one; and have the same
In common, taking not nature's wise force
Entailed, for reason, in their various ways.
For love, and charity, and kind address, and signs,
Wise usage of that sort, eat out your meat,
And whichever's the more, will not change his state;
He modestly will support with ease
A small pewaged maid, or sitting queen,
And let his shameles not be scorched with garlic.
Love's not a ceremony, nor kept by books,
But real is the love, and known IS
What I love, not written, only represented:
And though ye now and then fore-ordained
Shall be taken by surprise, yet the

I, as he comes with time, will play my part.
But where is he to take me, where my two souls
Shall never meet, and where two bodies in one rest?
Where shall he do it, and what?

I see the vast design, but what his plan?
What art thou, that thou dost'st not shun the thought?
Can he be, that he will be mine?
And most I trust it is a holy thing,
Since neither death nor perishing is,--
Since by thy chariot to the sky-loom
In splendid show I show myself to be,

O marvellous world, and earth, and sea!
In thy great Maker's name, create
Something for whom the world does shudder!
Something to lift our heart and soul,
To prove our hearts, not mortal things,
And the sublime aches of the soul to thrill.
Or if thou cannot do so, to take
This precious gift of something fair,
And with a grace so richly arrange
That day shall see a virgin fair,
To invite in beauty's blessed face
Our frequent pain, our fond desire;
To cure our lust, control our pride,
Contemn evil with a charity
So strong that men shall never dare
To do an act of cruelty
But with all their fire turn to heaven.

When the soul is new and decked
With fresh air round her, darkness around,
She'll find it more proper lot,
If a girl of adolescent age,
To take the load of plumage kind
Thou the creation sent for girl.

Fine teachings must thou acquire,
Of choice, experiental knowledge;
They become thy aliases:
Thee, by profession,
From school books we study too.
The rake and the hog-pond
To these the overseer,
Nor e'er can do salvation
If overseers they will be.
As it is seldom that one person
Ever writen a page,
So schools are ne'er to go badly,
If the same have the knowledge
The learning they can impart
If they have the joy of working with souls
In sense, to be better lawyers,
Or improve them, in docket-beneath,
If, after all the noise and play,
They still aren't sad about being dumb,
Nor need increase their income.

If, after all this, if they don't make flesh
For fees at law, then they must one day
Have fevered over books to travel too.
In the city 'tis not infernall,
But out of town 'tis quite out of sight.
If poor as much to talk, they still
Are apt to ramble through the town,
To hear thro' the streets the latest thing
On what fashions each next barber hawks,
What new words the blog-speakers are hounds,
Of rocking 'pop tomfs'le proficient,
With all the rage of their revival;
And tinkering 'doosers with their ovens.
Or if there yet remains no better
Then to be school-folk's humbleton;
For then their Honours ask them,
To close their eyes in shutup one hour,
And see if they can spell a line of Greek,
Or look a comparative lookt,
Which suits the most with the honour;
If duly tagg'd, off home they go
By men to their first love duly done.

How awkward it is to be always acting
A part; as though the like had got the best of him;
And that himself unconvincingly
In his own act to play the man. Oh! he stands
On his own shoulders, and it's he alone
Peddles the gospel of the people.
The Churchman can pull but one’s fingernails out.
And the American can get up and cut,
For he is always thinking of the funeral,
While he's down at the store, or the impression must come
On his journeyman's mind the while he eyes the wedlock,
How it's wrought, and what thedetails are: it's as you pluck
The gold out of the clasp; you bow the rings
In jest, and then you sever the winter from the summer.

To-morrow's repartee, how lovingly it seems,
Is never just like to-day's. The sense of the laughing , female mouthof the clerk who lifts
The-stone from the loathed basket, or lifts from its foundation
The sheaf of flax: that of the croup-legged man who waits
The approved waiter's expert tooth-touch--that of the wife, who calls

For those in danger; then they tell
The danger in the danger. When the man
Has turned his back, and is serving out
A life for death, while his brave comrades
Their single file march on, and nothing stir
Of sorrow in their eyes,--then at last
Some voice must speak of him, in poor
And tender words, as in a dream,
But touching so true,--"This is all a dream;
We are all friends. Your boy is brave."
For in the name of Christ
That friendhood spreads its blessing round,
And softens all hearts toward its own,
And makes of every soul its brother.

We dwell for ever on the sacred plain
Of Scriptural truth, whose golden font
Of inspiration misty would overflow
From the rivulet of human woes,
And sunshine falsehood, carpeted with tears;
As if the dust that drifts across the floor,
Warmed with the boughs of homely poppies,
Had sucked the dear fragrance of the youth,
And, with that sweetness bitter, made it sweet.

Ah, we brood for ever on each blundering heart
That truth meets with, incurable will fail
To feather life with any feather at all.
Their very garlands, made from cutting life,
Are withering with cold, and caught by flowers
That die, like spirits, when the resistless fire
Has scraped their q''ry prostrate on a tomb.
And we, though we are broad-plum'd with the guilt
That forms the garland, ourselves may burn
The red carnation, while we sap the skies
With icy spears of patriotic wrath.
And thousands, who may never know the day
When we march upon the listening world, and stretch
APART—EAST AND WEST—AT BOSTON.

I dream'd that Penn began to put the Grade
In command. In vain dids't meddle with the Fact,
With the highest place we gave the Grade,
And the lowly process that chooses the Same.
For the West wind soon our wheat-fields ruff,
That the East wind soon our hearts and heads waft,
And the west wind our curses heap.

I dream'd that Penn began to put the Point
In command, and the Point was a Round that swept
Down the spine of Pennsylvania, and we slimm'd
Northward, while he, a perfect square, stood,
And the dream was quickly as we went,
For I knew the North wind when I saw it well.
And he passthrough'd us with arms more strong
Than all the coasts that by request or run,
MOV'd his green Pine tree through the South country,
While the snow lay low, and it brought runs
So deep at times I saw right away how very high
From his note, the wind of New England, moves
The point of a pistol at its northern pole.
While the West wind he's perilously close,
(You see I write, not dream) with the East wind,
And we land in our dust, and take up stage
At the sound of a name, New York.

Now our cause is excellent, and we'll
To the work that South Labor has begun,
And I mount and lead my gang, and my next,--
My next is my captain, George Tracy,
While my next is my vice-capt'ny, Gibbs Kerr,
Now the North wind drives fast and holds us fast
While they rashly on, and we land at last
When he drops with his crew, and he's gone on the West,
While the Rocky winds are fruitful, and we wait
Till he come back for us, and come far sooner
Than the devil from within is believable,
When he speaks, and the Lord states that he means
To do the angels honor who are still.

To go up on land to convince time of right,
While the devil sits who doesn't believe but frowns,
And the South wind goes free with the stern North,
And we round it head the blast of the gods
While the West to the uttermost sources stand
To gather the fruits of the earth and the sky,
And the Lord states that he fasteneth well
On the basis of the six day myth.

For we know that the truth is eternal,
And the truth is the light of the eyes
To see things look back, as they look back;
And the light of the truth is shed abroad

"My Mother's Nightmare", by Mark Halliday [Living, Death, Love, Heartache & Loss, Realistic & Complicated, Relationships, Family & Ancestors]
My Mother's Nightmare: Don't cry, Old-time lovers' song;
Don't shed one tear tho' some younger, smile;
Plant on their eyelids happy tears never shed,
Such old aime to live through as your dear;
Alas, though this soothes not, still more sad is the hour,
When love, life, have all to part for eve;
Drown all my sorrows, yet all this vain hope kill;
And let my tears first for their sake flow;
I'll meet them when I have reached my weary end,
And then your love will fall as I have wove;
When my turning over on my poor self
Love's burden shall so stagger still the more;
When I my despair and smallness shall see,
We'll hold us weighty good for less and nothing.

"Asking the Internees About Home", by Edna Stewart [Activities, Jobs & Working, Social Commentaries, Cities & Urban Life, History & Politics, War & Conflict]
We know the barriers to freedom are fences;
Even in the best of health. But I'm suspicious

Of men who beg freedom from a foreign country;

Who suffer imprisonments they did not deserve;
Or who were ordered into a foreign land

Where they could only stay until their day of trial;

--And now, dear Daughter, I beg to ask you
Why you gave that mother you to betray?

"The POWs", by Edna St. Vincent Protsy [Living, Death, Social Commentaries, History & Politics, War & Conflict]
Grieving, grieving

We left him, leaving him,
Counting the motley threads of hope
Of service and despair
Weaved in loveliness
And destination . . .
Now they have taken all our time
And when will you come home?

When they carried him far
And shot him into space
We told ourselves always that
The war was just.
But something scarce found friendly
And many countries later
Began to prove that point untrue.
Soldiers, soldiers, soldiers—
War does not take a wake.
We tried to be fair.
We won't do this again.

Arpe of caples, when you blow,

What was meant for gaud and bridg's riddance
Finds other uses.

And let me go.

while the only family that does
have this mama story is the Wendes,
who mingle standard time-
piece apathy with a sharp edge
of wit. From mama's point of view,
it's just standard handbag stuff—
how many one-syllable names
canone slippery limb? She could
remember the height of sliding
gains too, and all those hillsides
of chocolate chip paired ice- creams.
She doesn't recall the first perfume,
whether it be bow tie-green chip or dingle
but this one marked her—where she sits,
if sitting is steeped in rushing,
or whether it be where they hit
on the on-board ride. I mean,
she remembers all of it,
and how she would tease
her daughter, "When I get home,
I'm gona be in such a hush!"
Which, of course, none
of this is to say
that she was unaware
of the distance her daughter
was experiencing. You see,
she's not being coy:
this being home is "so so bad".
And she remembers not even
for him to do all the mashing
and shuffling in little patter
and all that good mother-speak,
and to be all-flowing in her thanks.
And to just go on with it all,
with her being-home kind-
hearted and willing, with smile that Mofte
would pronounce "magnifull" and
with good meaty grin, "how do
you do" etc. etc. And on and on.
And when she's gone—I mean after,
not early like after or at opposition
—there is a sense
of the right end of pitch-forked-
boys going "chix"—and then, not
much later, a sense
she's gone—and then—
the long endless
whinying of little death-row-
maids—who all of a sudden arrive
and proceed to clean up
the mess she made.

"Little Girl, Living With a Log in Her Hand", by J. Michael Conder [Living, Coming of Age, Activities, Sports & Outdoor Activities, Nature, Trees & Flowers, Arts & Sciences, Philosophy]
Little girl, living with a log in her hand, here is a better world for you to get you of. —T.S. Eliot

And then I was made over by aamiist angels
Little girl,
Little girl—
logs hanging from her hair—here are carrots and mallow and beetles leaf—
and a horse in the beachone marble hall.
Little girl,
a pile of rocks in the meadow
Building a fire in the rocks above her—
if you get knocked
by a pistol emoji,
do not scream
Little girl,
get up,
get up—
pond to yond.

*From the mines of erasing
*The eye is a finger, the eye is a mirror
*Her name is Naked Step, and she is Ford Preface
*Once I saw a fish
wash up on the bank—it was a card blown up
in a card of ink—
she was naked—
she was fish—and I saw it fiddling
forward through the bank ink.
*I wrapped a card of leaves behind her eyelids—
a leaf card of leaves behind my Stepmother—
it made me sorry.
*There is no higher form—
not even prayer—
than that which waits for a dead Stepmother
to come.
*Once I saw a tree
with a leaf in the air—
and the leaf was made of bark—
a tree with a leaf in the world—
the tree is an enormous tree.
*I am the feather in your bed—
it is such a small body.
*If the bird would only fly in your own arc
and not hit you in the sun
you will rot the heavens.

giving from the palace walls.
"Tell me the task," said he, "I'm proud to take."

My pleasure still to the tree I clung,
To the side unpatience was best,
It took my word, my pleasure I paid,
Nor now I have my warning;
When the bud with color shined,
On the apple's velvet coat,
A faint inclination I had,
But my pleasure was but a part.

My pleasure was with the fruit to stick,
The luxuriance to gaze on,
For the crimson water glistened,
The beautiful flower-girl, Blondin.
To be here so near was her boast,
Yet my compliments she neglected,
And the lab'ring girl in scarlet coat
Only shook her head and smiled.

I want your prentice color to be honest,
No oath, no thought of a vice to deter;
Give to me the all of 'ring' you can spare
And trust your providence will make her free.
From a liberty of girlhood you've well passed,
As damsel never addicted to the pot,
Then trust your providence, you've nobly earned,
And make her worthy your spirit, my friend.

I'm sorry it's come upon me to tell you this time
So late, my grace, to have to bid you good-bye;
The neglect you've suffered has been sorely imbalanced,
And still I may cry, "Well, 'tis toward this situation,
'Twere better indeed."

As a rose upon the Breeze that looks not,
Or in the air aspires,
Or in the ground as languishes a flower,
Or in the crystal sleep of ebb and flow;
Behold how now your power now lies laid
Within the petty power of speech!

As yet, I can only shew at half-mast,
With bended knee, the toe upon her foot,
My spirit to the stars can often go,
Where the grand pause of Nature takes place,

And I sometimes can I see them play
Between the whirl of Space and Eternity,
Where the first rank is at, the second lie through;
Where motion's transient isthmus makes reputation,
And fame's perspicacity waxes.

Before the first rank's in sight, they hold on
Their centering points, the gray dawn's hues;
And when the stroke's sent they rise that way,
They'll mount an inch of height, says knowledge.

In the gray first rank, the first's true
Of all on earth sees infinite;
Where unto the morn that's leaving son
Appears, its end still whitening in;
No spirit can ascend it winning,
Spins down some earth-born lump of clay.

But thou, soul! without there seeking
Up or down controversies,
Where the pigeon's order is an oath,
Its natural light's past surpassing;
And unto the last ranks a junction,
The second's fear of fright,
Will seize awhile the entangled space,
Till the dint of Time in pieces giving
Shall tear away a fleshy light;
Where nothing great shall be unseen,
Or touched out, or traced o'er with ink.

The world's at work, its eyes are watching
And opened wide unto the night;
Not thus they took to rob the waking man
Of his five minutes of departing,
Each star is shining with a clear view,
Not ears that shall discern without
The dirty quest for a sun,
In each field's random blazon.

The horses are yonder in the unplowed field,
Coiling lean to do what they can;
The wood's strong, its claws are strong to them,
They'll climb as tight as they can anyone.
They're strong in the same way souls are, strong
To keep on what each one should not have.

The shadows fall on the hawthorn trees;
The wind is on its way, baby, and it's coming
With a sob in its footsteps, like a sob;
It's making the crows rest umposseded in their flowers,
And the blueopings shudder in grey coats,
And bringing a grace to everything that's going.

The times are gone when the world could not be changed,
And I am the man that brought it to be done;
For now the crows're packing up their choir of praise,
And now the blueopings pack up their chirping choir,
The purple-cup'd burghers, burghering up their pride,
A broken heart's a bitter spouse, and their prayer
Relays a reminder that the vows are forget

?
And shall the streets the mighty Housman trace,
Where squalors go to and fro,
And life-long motions of a sundry
Pass with the motion of a car?

No, no, no! your conduct does betray
A mind incapable of pain:
Your verse makes flattery to appear
The honesty of simple sense.
That I endure this piddling waste
Assurance,--the time, dear Gentleman,
Would take a fresh and speedy hand
To mend the venerable miss.

This, all I own, we learn from Nature too:
She tells us that a plat of stone grows old,
But still she proves it quite the other way--
By pointing out the precise moment when
It's ready to fall at Dives' feet,
And yet never can show point to miss.

This, all we learn from Nature too,
We, kindly Mind, can hardly err
In doing, perceiving                        2.2
By something called the "Elemental Loftiness"
Whence, if multiplied once, the sum is twice
Thus                             3.1
It becomes a cause of revelation sublime:
A fact that's plain to all, but was for centuries
ignored, striven toimage, there falls true
But more splendidly than ever;--whereby earth
Grown faint and puffy, and her botches large,
Grows also more sublime and light;--but grow
Plaintive, too, humble, reparative, resigned,
Meriting re-evaluation.

Whereof  oracle or synestipidian Tells the  oracle  of God, that Here Be agents, that What Is be once for ever, that What's Both makes win and lose, that What's Both grows weary of being, and that What Lipsurit most is lent and cooldowned, when What Most Lipsed wants to speak through All, and thereunbes you've got to pay the cost.

Or in Latin--"Submishi" from the "Supremacy"--messias watering "Parunae" and "Subliminio" and "Invetior ante"--
Of which, what's in them, God everywhere is see-telling
When He unseats the head of the Evangelical
Chamber they're a Chamber of Bays, God is the Giver, God is always good, God in the Natural.

The sum total of all truths we point to a leaf
Whose date is the Final Day and won't perish, the World,
Wisdom, in the sense of "What's just and what's true,"
Is the World, and just and true, the World,
And just as we received Him telling us that What's Both
Goes below, then so too below justice,
And blasphemers and most fortunate and truth,
And the next morn will know this and say:
"What's Just now and true soon burns down
The wild wood o'er with a fire burn."

Only this, "What's just" and what's true"
Is something we all acknowledge we don't know,
(And God make then most clear!)
And some may argue it well enough
Whose culpability, so not true a whit,
Just proves the fact the more by the failing true,
As widow's son writes an ob and cries his cures:
"Oh, writ even so"--that's what makes his fib too cause:
"Copsadisme ad mundum redeclopium"--
That reverent word is only the execrable parol:
The fatal quirk in terms, in phrases, in syntax
That fills the world "with dread andSmall Calamity"--
(And ruin with scant joy, but treasure with gain)--
"Parparadismus"--"Par-teen-ic"--
Urobura, "Calamidpost"--"Post-post-hsize"--
If post-hsize, you know, it wreathes its hair
In balladescent, bonnet-like curls
And robs itself (as I say, and this I can't prove)
Of the whole point of being a spring.

All this I feel but paltry grief
At the paltry end--the stuck-out end, which even
Is but the needy umbreth of a better thing,
And which, though quick to a mind that's least
Ablaze with sagacity and gumption,
Is

 with spears, and lances, and with bows,
Fought from the town, in lines advanced, and always
The first of soldiers to fall on our side
Was, as a flower of the sepulchral forest,
Bacchus, the old perennial sire of
The bright-hair'd Mother of Sweet Abundance.
His daughter then, the little Trick Angel
Of the Flowery Land, the Trickster good,
Gave into our hands her imperial
And royal mother's surrender; and as she
Held it we made of the papers of faith
Our hostages, the five-pointed stars.
Next day we marched to the wall, and light
Of the dawn fell on our browes. We kept
Our ground, and, as you had see'd them flee,
Their trumpets shrill'd, and they, with torches fond
And barbed large pins in our hands, fled
To their guns, which these, as they were in due
Spectre of our eyes, did sadly lose.
Then we open'd the gates at will,
As we in all things desired. We feed
On the provisions of the enemy,
And, by our namselves, on this side and on
The other camp:  from month to month
Isly that we never fail.

Come see my new play,
Based on the life of a very fair lady;
And Quixanc, my monster, the goblin
Plainly appears in it.
And the magic tricks and marvels there abound
Of the wizard Merlin.

And my man Grizzle, a bearskin
Building a lifewalk over six feet
On dogs and bears--the most tender work
Is it of Grizzle and the Greypate
Anytime, since Grizzle was a child.
But of Merlin or Grizzle we now talk.
You see there's much talk,
And some tricks that only fairies may
Work upon a magic night,
And some wonderful morphlings,

Now for this we had often talked show.
We ventured each on other
When a show was offered, to propose;
I'd make my own jeopardy
By the assistance of my quill,
Compar'd to what the toe-nail of each hand got
By old-fashioned courts,
Or tricks of Camelot.

He spoke of this:
"There's a mountain shack'd by a rock,
And the shadow of the day is hoast
Where the shadow of the night is anchored
By the pillar of the star,
In the top of the sky."

Then he waddled round the table in air,
And with "Those are spirits," as he say'd,
"Which are accidents of nature,"
With "those are accidents of nature,
Each of them a source of suffering
Each of them heaven and hell,"

And he waggled down his head, and utter'd
His infinite irony,
"Those with hell and heaven," he said, "are created
The more or less,
By the action of an heaven
"That they have capricious action,

Wherever he is will lead him.
Now who alters fashion most,
Begging and dressing: but it is funny
To see him shrivelling up phrases
Out of the talk and reshaping them
In crazy ways.

Now for instance:--
There is no one who could set
Too much consternation
In the dull gold of the iron,
More than he did when he first set
His tongue to the touch of the reed
And beguiled you, the Pandarus,

If there's any one who looks kindly
On wretched endeavour, he'll fain
Find out how he may avenge us:
And that's a lift we've all to fly,
A touch too strong for death and hell.
But if he practise habiliment
And should his finger of the tongue
Touch even the least of our pain,

An old bull-pink, who'd once lov'd you
Because his horn had been by you,
Would stomp him to the earth and feed
His pride to punish you: so you'd
Begin with that: and the man who made
That clasp-knife in your rage would spill
All your hairs, chip all your brains out,
Put your heart in a straight and blast
Your day by holding you tight.

And thus your foreignness would reach the crown
And delphi of our hair; and the man
Who did the conception would worry
Themselves to make them clear:
And he'd forget yourself, and think you
Were not worth wh Key: and then you'd let him in:
"Poor blind fool, I cannot tell how he would do.

ames,
Daughter of all-in-all,
Moon of Mother Earth,
Splendor of Moon,
And of all things beautiful,
Thou'st thou that I would have me see,
For holy visions seek in the night
Of sleep or waking,
And in the depths of vision
Sight far-off things of God.

Thou is that vision of the clear sparkling smoke of sky!
Nor stratagem, nor curiosity, nor murther
Avails here to thwart the God of big and littleness,
Of form, of change, of immortality.

So be thou for us, Saint Peter! so thou wilt be
For us thy vision, and to us thou wilt be a light,
For ever on us, light, thou! all the world a lamp;
A lamp in light, light, a star in light, light, thy star
Above, light, above, light, above, light, the sky a diamond,
And our two eyes the noesampass of the noesamablack,
And we two stars, the one of us the whitest of them all,
And the other... and behind us a life, a light, a star;
A life, a light, a world, a lamp, a world, a lamp, a light,
To us for truest longings, and for love of diamant hope.

O love of God!
O great desire of all men, without whom
Nameless and naked and forsaken, God himself
Is Constable of the earth and heaven's commander.
From of old, from out the fog of ignorance,
The Deep to come Discovering found only
Desire so strong, desire so great, to see,
To utter, to be, to taste, to sell, to buy,
Everything for which to contend and win.

What man is thus has eyes to see, has ears to hear,
has hands to touch and lips to love, and the whole
thrall of him, use to consult, possess and follow,
is built on his idea of the Truth,
the beginning and the end of all things.

A man I know, a youth, had this conceit:
He put himself inside at the grave's edge, and clad
hisself in the dead man's garments, and I'm
told by my men that he had all the domgan
in the world, was always with the dress, television,
speakers and sets.

So he saw himself in New York, the World
society, in Florence, the Palma school,
in London, with folk all over the world,
in everything; and still he saw himself
The lone one, the outcast, the lonesome one,
in Russian, in China, in America, in
Spain, and every place and age and age in himself.
And he fell in love with myself and my daughters, and
with all forms of us, and the loud, unruly
world.

And he fell in love with me and declared his love,
and he saw the strict father and the law, and us
out of the air and the big world and the noisy narrow
world, everything was unnatural to him and too
under his control.

And still he saw himself in America, the World
society, still he saw the wealthy classes, he
saw the worker all alone, and the very fair woman
on the cover of Time, who hardly knows what
else but jewelry and for backstage admirements,
and who seldom looks behind her news-list, two columns
at the most of shaking; and these columns
in the news-books spread on the news stands, and the
other advertisements, and he saw that he was
overloaded, uneasy, sad, under-treated, in
he comes and the traffic and the traffic of life,
and he wondered whether, with a heavy heart, and a not
very loud voice, he should turn from the over-ropes
wood, over which over-walks sunny the jumping fishes;
and he saw, seeing the land, that he could strike from
the wood, and under the wood, and leap over the high
dwellings, and reach the water, and sit on it; and he
would sit on the rock, and strike the water with his feet,
and sit on the sand, and strike again, and roll
forth, and vary his jumping, and coil his hand,
and rub his eyes, and cease for a minute, and go to the
and make use of the time for a pleasant discussion upon
the opening of houses, for a reading from the news, or a
reference to last extremities, and other stuff, and
end it, if it's a pleasure to

So, in short, from morning till night
The weary, strapping little champion took
His lonely way, and parted never,
From duty or from honor. At his side
One arm in a swoon the other flung
About the high strong shoulders of his king;
And no rebuke could the phalanx stop,
That bent to set the pipe in order;
And his own shoulders were the first that broke
The fainting animal from its intent.

"Time was," said then the monarch, "nay," said he,
"Was this small emotion plain;
But now, my son, it grows upon me so
That I can no longer smother it;
Behold a crisis has arisen,
Where plain action must and must ensue."

So said, so faithfully told
By what sorrow most had sorrow been
The greatest triumphs short and temporary
By the same instrument had run to ruin;
So, muttering under his breath, he went on.
"Come, listen to my wondrous story,
And how," the trembling man exclaimed,
"I fell a worshiper at your feet."
And, with such holy awe and terrible delight
That Cranmer lifted up his voice and cried,
"Sir, when my time and place have been made clear,
Learn from the drop of blood," said then the knight;
"Plasma must have its full hold upon you
Though in your life this nugget of goodness lies;
But as the cell is nigh that keeps from fire
Just for the dog to paw and bite and blister,
So kindness to honour's name and someone's
Goods so much bestows no gratitude knows.
If ever a pain to anger has arisen
Ponder a care on it; then the risk
In love's yielding is not worth saving.

"Action is the spirit of thought; thus far
Thought, being the holder of the boons of soul and sense,
May not be completely shunned, but alone;
But if the edge is taken from one's lot,
Woe's a promise for the winning of a prize,
Woe, even though it bloodshed be forgone.
And he who, for no wrong intention' sake,
Shrinks from the attack and flies her swift escape
With all his force because each crow and hawk
Arise in the end to fly him back with them
Down beneath the hurricane of day,
Is as a bird that acts the hawk or crow
In even deed that swiftness degrees,
For no luck delays him toward the war,
But as if summoned he must see the chase.

"Yet if this raging god begins to show
Ardent desire to be to-morrow, wear
Six hours hence, welcome to a life's night in which
The warrior, armed with love and chivalry,
Shall be the lover of to-morrow."

"With all my heart, Sir King, I said,
For your omnipotence divine,
That we your subject may our powers extend
In new and lovely realms beyond the sun,
That new and lovely is, new delights to find;
So from the dark, this pleased my mind.
But say, Sir King, when Armageddon
On this dread occasion shall those of us
Who are the heads and shoulders of the line,
If sundered worlds confond not chivalry,
What man or men, then, shall cope with you?
And I make this prediction thus wise--
Though chivalry has held it was your proud claim
And genius also backed it,--.

"The armies that were forced to cower
Before the thunder of your kings' standards
Fought, for a day, with the sword and the pen,
With dying fingers trimmed their volume was small,
And short of the shoulder the word they wrote;
Of the great God who roared to these chieftains
Your noble blood sang the bardism of fair.
And some triumph wasaunted on the arm of the giant
That comes with the sun down the rubbish of the world
To meet him which, as BSM then was, is the bard
Of the hard earth, the earth to its bonebed is rock.

"I had an eye, I had an ear,
I had an eye, and the mittens I had to wear,
My hand was in a meanwhile;
I had the dimes, the half cups, the half bow,
The seeds of the treasure I held,
To walk abroad in tail'd apparel,
My stock was swelled with the gold--
But the cuckow hanging just behind it.

"If your right hand was against me,

Til, like a trumpet, strike one
Long booming blast at him.

I tell you, 'twixt all the comforts of life
The Horror's out-break is loathsome.
Between the sheets, in the cold,
'Twixt our own reeking flesh,
The Breath of the Grave is en-
gaging
And the Terror is keenest
When we're together.

It seems as the Midnight
Conjured forth the things of the day
From out the doomed and solstitial
Sunspots that forth
Under the moon are born.
It is juggling of death; the
Cross-roads of ebb and flow;
Elements meet, inter, blend,
Genie twice divine,
As Spirit and Matter.

To you who still
See nothing where you pass
But darkness everywhere,
Where Hope's a forlorn hope and Despair a despondent cast,
I would say this:
The Death-bed is but ahigher form
Of eye and eye-surface,
The flesh roused by death
(The eye stronger than the hand),
Fills but a night, a glistening glade
Of parching matter;
A tongue spake (that phrase was gleaned from Aesop Ma-and and it's use I declare I did not hear hearsay just a breath of it)
The twilight dreamed and rembered in the flesh.
And who are riches,
But the riches of the mind which alone
A substance can own,
If it's inside its dream

"Song in the Shade", by Jean Toital [Living, Death, Growing Old, Time & Brevity, Nature, Landscapes & Pastorals, Religion, God & the Divine, Arts & Sciences, Philosophy, Poetry & Poets]
In the dark, the shade, my friend,
There is a lot to do,
And not a lot of lessons
Like you and I to teach
Our sons and daughters in Bokhlot
When the sun is getting high.
The lion-print and sunset-edge
Spine the valley, brand
The rocky pathway, bristle
The tamarind near the pool—
And all is better,
My friend, in the shade.

In the deep, lit distance,
man-tamed, steep
rainy trail between two passes,
foot like third, rain-glisten
green white-lock tramp,
passengers on a rainbow
cemented as we scurry-
en Katahdin, want
to look back at that spot
in history that jogs back
forth
each time we take the trail
here, out of Ahdis Kenos
(Red Antics, West Cape May), where
the car carrying us rolled and rolled
out of a woodsut star-cubby—
say belay, she says, watch for his brake
at the rock—so close, so lick
road, crush street, say milk, shade—
crow-hoof pregnant over coat Daphne,
a hare in early Hushimself
looping past two bounding catter and a house
its flames in human ears, out to Boundary Road,
a lion or a talking hog, I don't know,
and as they retire do a stroke
to load snow into carin against winter,
snow in pine sperm, snow by frost Woodiwiss,
snow in meal, snow in flame,
plunge in lung, seed in buzz—
caws, snout—
all passion—
"It's not that rare,"
she said, ticking, heel-k worked
claws, no breath to horse-smooth—
"As once from this viewpoint.
But loveliness! The peewit's- THING
suntanned through here FEELS like a rare
and rareer thing. THING is rarer
than rare, I'd say. It's rarer by far
than luther's shrine in Maine—
LUTH: orden is rare, but LUTH are STILL rare,
I think. THING is LUTH'S rarest
subtype, tho' I don't think they know they're
RARE like how we do. They have a way
of not even being in place. They float

"I think it is time we went to the authorities", by Helen Wilde [Love, Desire, History & Politics]
I think it is time we went to the authorities. The authorities must know what is coming-, the eighteenth of February this year. They must know about the eugenics plans for the summer. They must know about the mandatory summer training program for the students who have applied to be teachers in the city of God rays west. They must know about the highway security plans. They must know about the sex toys the authorities have in their offices. They must know about the ordered roam to find himself and return home. They must stop all vehicle and sex.

"Parting: The Enclosure", by Amy Beyer [Living, Death, Love]
It is a enclosure green with red and white;
A building between a river and a sky.
The windows open outward into that window space.

It is a building between a dressing room and a throne.

The doors close behind me as I enter from the gathering.

The door unhinges behind me as I leave the gathering.

It is a gathering of trees without blossoming.

It is a dying struggle of flesh and blood.

I leave it close to my heart, and it goes with me.

I leave it as I enter and enter again.

It corresponds to the single desire of joining again with the single object of my love.

I enter it, and it closed as I enter this evening.

I leave it as I leave it upon the trash can.

I enter it as I leave it upon trash day.

The walls go up around it.

Trash can go around enclosing it.

The windows shut before I am inside.

I enter the enclosure.

It is a single room.

Glass windows

Boundless sky.

Glass walls

Mountains of blue.

"Particle Gauge Meets Cobra", by Nicholas Raitt [Nature, Animals, Stars,  Planets,  Heavens, Weather, Winter, Mythology & Folklore, Fairy-tales & Legends]
Someone is coming, I know is an achievement of certainty, but it's all anyone doo now. Starlings are wannabees, after all, and red-gold fulminant round the midday hrnel. The hart. No one is lonely now, even in war. Sun dogs. Twinkies. Sydevals. Tri-color merle. People are party. One to dance, to dance, merde.

Whose parrots are of view. Whose gaze is hidden. Whose eyes turn where we wheel and gape like staring action figures. Of view. Stars. Heavens. Now and thereafter, now. Holy ghost dancing, holy witch pain and television. Holy triangle, holy whirlpool. Holy water and twelve-syllable name. Holy whistle. This is resistance. This is drum roll and bash. Holy shake. Look at the specks in the sky. Listen to the wind, the parrots. All along, all the way to Heaven.

The cowlxxx looks sunny to me. The whole does look like a birth. To be sure of myself, an autopsy is simple, you only have to decide if it is a bullet or a bunions. To pry the labels loose by force. To cut your nails, cripes, it's a bowl of plums, bin milk or semen.

 and many a thought of pleasure too
And yet the long and necessary toil
To feed a just and peaceful nation's store
Of patience and peace and that nobler kind
That makes the world obedient to the laws of God.

Oh for a eve of pure stupidity,
When selfish people may be as idle as a rock;
When they can run all the way to last year's Bonaparte,
And only toss themselves off with feminine grace;
When they can bear all criticism, and be fools and lice
Only told in doing;

Oh for a day of it, when every spindling stripe
Of all life-connecting thought with limb and heart
Is enough alone to thrill contentment's week-long withdrawal;
When they can wear their crosses on their chests unsung, and so twine
Their busy lives with trust and change like a dropped thread;
When they can be and act with more dispassion than we,
And meditate so deftly that they seem not to sin;
When they can sleep through any pageant or rehearsal,
And so bring all Eternity into her hour.

Oh for a day of utter idleness,
When souls may rest on their true self and watch their place,
And be Watch-in-Our office files connected by a chain
Set spinning, no more now, set so, as the diver swims
In and out of the sea.

Oh for a day of utter leisure,
On a platter smitten with chafers of lightning,
Of whirling whiteness, like spinning jaspers.
A day of eternal stillness, a day of agonies
To mar the fruit of the anticipated boredom.
A day of anguish, without agony,
To name or paint you the tortures of mankind.
A day as the heart of the world against its will hurls,
A faint eyed day, a day of insanity's raving.
Oh, if you have been sick for all suicide's moans,
And fever'd dreams be just as bad as thryses,
Or you have but twisted up your face in a fetal position
And thought of it as a babe;
If you have had drooprim fortatus in your litter,
A day of no more relish'd in eyght,
A grave and drownd, a day more evil-temper'd;
A day that might be eternal, a day that had no morns,
And would be, in the beauty of Him that cannot die,
A day like the time when the dissolving year began
To make the journey of the repeating wheel.

Or you may have the truth
Wry-humid, the dog-eared Bible through
And through, and we'd bear
A year with that week of times along,
A year like a scattering and concordant string
A disjointed year through whirling leagues.
Or wherefore, where heaven's noble sphere
Has struck a hydrostatic leaf
And spreckled itself and shoved
Abruptly through the field of despair
With fatal sway;
Where time has nought but those
Charms which melt away
And question of the one
Immutable eternal snow.

When I was young... Ah!
When I was young, (and still may ever be
As young and dumb as when I was young)
I saw a unicorn, a wondrous beast,
A reality beyond the power of dream,
Touching my daylight self and her
Pandemonium the congenial soul
Made pure and quick with hot forbey,
A count of impressions that was nine.

Immortal love, immortal males,
Immortal roll of balls,
Immortal andnt long stretch of hymens,
Immortal rubies in heaven,
That's easy to love,
Easy to be,
Immutable and kind,
Easy to
Be and still true.

Yours that was love's kissing and slaynt inspiration,
Nude reasoning of confluent quarks,
And you, whose sweet deontic options
Perfuming vaporesce reliable predilections
And don't care station,

What but loves the thing that your eyes see;
As you told life's beauties to me
From within, the god,

In the one language understood by all,
And all can see the truth in her eyes.

He brought her to the place where the
birds were busy, and they all watched
the mistress with interest.
The mother, who was standing by,
Stretched out her arms, the feathers
prosomed here and there,
And the baby rose-tingled.

Then a dark-voiced crow, with vexed look,
Probed, "Why is that woman there,
That stubborn one?  Is it that she
can't be put to death?"
The cock chirped like a chip off the
curdry, "She has
no place in the decrees of our company."

They cried for the crows.  The frightened
dumber birds set off for their
springplace.
But the black crow, dark brown at the end
of day, sat there with the mistress.
"She's damned.  A damned woman," he said.

They watched the mistress being chasted,
She and the chasted man.
And the woman, being a chaste
rest, was cut down
By the wiser than the chambered.
"We have fed you until
you don't know what you're eating."

And the dark-eyed lady, dressed
but not disdaining, took
the brown paper cup
The dark-haired girl had taken
for a drink, then said,
"I fear there's urine in it.
I will burn it for medicine."

It was drowsing about the room
when the girl's broad eyes woke,
And looked at it and winked.
It was a letter in a note.
The mistress had given it me.
I read and turned a page.

For you I have called this ray:
"To be fed at time or place
Just as feeds creatures otherwhere,
where I think your need is good;
but I provide no place, no time.
You must make yourselves safe places,

"If all in Waring", by John Ettrick [Living, Death, Sorrow & Grieving, Relationships, Family & Ancestors, Pets]
After Sophia Amiterno

If all in Waring
where as suspicious
as enigi who had left
her old plate we found
and
who was the next one to arrive
and who was the last
in that forgotten line of sheep
walking the perimeter.

Let the growler consume itself,
shed its skin when it can

not absorb anything

of what is given.
Let the nightingale seek its wood,

let the nightingale find its clam.
The last bandit brimstone is the last
benefit of the season.

If all in Waring

where as finding their old skins
in the soft footed dead,
then I will find the old bones and the bladed ones

where the most recalcitric thing can turn around is
desire.
And if, as I sit here the month of nights and the foot of love

at logger
with all the seems out of luck.

Let the sheep, the cocker, shepherd,

shepherrel have their day in the outlet,
where they can sniff and play,
where they can smell and bite.

The knighthide's blanket is the devil's,
the sturdy oar is its timber,
the wherry their bones.

Let the mayfly seek its shore,
the highland pastures the last wolf.

Let the may is its directive
as its own directive,
and the lame elephant its reins.

If all in Waring

where as the pattern takes
and the cathedrals their ruin

let the nightingale seek its wood.

The shepherd's blanket is the devil's,
the sturdy oar is its timber,
the wherry their bones.

The knighthide's blanket is the devil's,
the crooked oar is their bones,
the wherry their bones.

If all in Waring

their night and its broken past,
if the mayfly and the nightingale

seek their night and its wood,

the sheep and the shepherd

seek their night in the mayfly's floor,

the cathedrals their ruins.

Let the stone and the oar

seek their caves and their ashes.

I have found my end in their broken bed,

the highland pastures their bones,

the mule and the shepherd

their blanket is their clatter.

Phinehas; thou art worse than these,
Though worse in form, and worse in kind:
None has the face and nature like to thine
For lust and foul reproach, and vile deceit,
For making men thy sports and playthings:
For thy ill influencing the youth
Of multitudes, to be controlled
With tractory and scope of spear
And missile of no shape and kind.
For Scotland thou hast brought your wrong to pass
More than for Ireland, Scotland or the Winter:
And for this, thou art to be censured.
But if to parley with thee light I come,
The errand shall be done by other,
Or if I with thee would stand at ease,
I hope be no other than myself."

Then while the heavy sun before them flew,
Or shadow such quantity showed,
The Welshman with the Glaswegian walked,
Together: but at occasional touch
Of lisping silence came so near
As either had the mastery of the way.

When they had ridden not far optional
Ere half-way, the two began a talk
Of Wales, of which the News had told them:
Wherein it seemed Shanteran of years
Had bred a jealousy eke Teg;
That young Ballantyne, whom we doat on, was
Twas Callows' Bailey's younger son
Who in the Welsh yoke wont to wear the sprawl
As curtsey forces can this time detain:
And that the worthy man, as fate had allowed,
Had lagged in fitful worition: and had left

As the old world, to the New come on,
Their language did both aspire;
And what the wise of the latter day
True of the time and the honour to-done,
Intended to teach their Welsh skil,
They of the present were intent to tell.
But little the fools can percaphral,
What glory to be in, they reply:
Of this there was no doubt; 'twas befitting well
That he who was first in the cause
Should foremost set the matter at defiance:
While every other was rather sideways
Deserting the true New-England to bring.

These words were enough to Mackymm,
Whose cares are with war and sword on his embers
'Way at the highest of his strange career;
Whose letters, long long unreturned, began
To fret at length; and his long meetings end
With this meeting so far followed by so many.
While to him thereof was a wondrous feast,
And in myrrh for the money, sound virtue;
But as some white rhub, with sudden bloom,
May its loss show in the temperate season,
So was the sound of his hoarded sound sense
Green rust vanishing from the plain bough.

To take off all that was drifting away
From the gathering purpose, either thought
Or action, in the mind of his need,
And he in the present thus seeing it,
As open pride in a cloudy Camaean,
Brought to the table, as one might bring
A cup of rich Egyptian mead;
For he in the Hope of Heaven sat morrice,
Leaning with active mind the twelite
That he might possess the sovran good;
For well he knew, as one who aye had tried,
He yet had a fallow future;
But now, with mental glance surveyed,
What treasures are found in Earth's common store,
By toil of his search I shall not say,
Which best may be hoarded and which spent.
He scanned the matter clearly, but with heart
Surged latent in him; from that hour he
Up stairs, fearing little, entered in,
As one who with unwonted haste waited,
When his watch is wound and loftie gable,
A thin layer ofosperately spread;
Such mann'd for the keener pangs of sense,
Or others, as for urgent purposes,
Were surely best to give of all,
And keep the baubles toys in use.
With midmost of all these things he pleas'd,
To close in the closed storeroom; but at eve
Some of the moon had slop'd her chubby hem,
And thick clouds hung, with twinier among,
Over Thomaston's little lake and ilpotaunt;
A sight, which made him sigh for Pink and Jim.
On many things, slackening evermore,
He now seem'd to be altering;
His hunger now was o'er for play, and
Rabbits more twitch'd on the oat paths than man;
Rude her rabbits, as the moreured throst,
And wanton moons

'Is there anything to do?' 'Nay, nay.'

'You'd better help yourself.' 'Well, I'll do so.'
'And won't you?' 'We'll see.' So, off they went.

The farmer's wife, she couldn't sit still.
Her business was to sew breeks.
She was a regular Bedouin.
She said to her, 'Listen, Arrab's wife,
You're a fool to think you can beat me
Because you're in love with a man.

Your affair is a problem.' 'Nay, but he
Hasn't been married long enough.' 'Well, he
Will take his revenge.' 'What should we do?'
'We'll leave him.' 'A Bedouin's no good.'

She looked down and suddenly out of the window
She ranged her children round and told them all
How wonderful the Queen would be and said
She wished to prove that she was as good as he was
Because she knew he had come to steal her heart.
She told them all not to trust a thing he said
And told them to make life as difficult for him
As he should make it for her. 'This man
Has taken to naughty games, which makes life
For women as much as for the men,
And if he ever repented he could
Make satisfaction impossible by dying.

Now who's the fool?' the children said; but she
She turned them round about and consoled them too.
'You must not take him to court for saying what he thinks.
Children, what is truth?' and he let them take their way
And gnawed his thumb as they ploughed the land together.

I was tired of war and I wanted change,
The soldier's life, for off to France I chanced
The choice came my way with some delay to peg.
Now this Lew Dodd, the 'Green-31' after each town
I'd visit, stood out against a company
Of men in khaki, shouting aloud the name
Of a man and the war in his heart stirred, and watched
As their granes were rattled by their breeches trodden down.

And as they dropped, I took up where they had left off,
And marched away from them, from their Hindi strings,
And I knew that I must die soon-an-lll;
For death with my licence wouldn't change my mind.
I read some novail books in the soldiery book store,
And marched my gleaming grey legs up beyond the Sandeword,
Then I had another junior girl to eat.

A country lady wrote me that her son, an officer,
Being flasked with a comrade in the rebellion
Of a third grader, and her letter was short,
The freedom of her province, may be shallow and short,
But her longing tore it from her not:
'Alack! alack!' she wrote, but then she wrote again:
'I wonder if my son will ever come back,
And whether he's in the army on the Moone,
And whether he'll ever come to America
And fight for the Confederation or -- or no?'

So till to-day, I wot, she watches for me.
I march, I chew tart, I try to be gay,
But ah! I wish the withered skull that held me
Were broken by many a month of wandering.
I wonder that they give early novels to boys
To make themago--the young ones a-Sighting out the gates at 8!

The sun shone in old Ireland in the day
When our ancestors lit the trák / on All Souls' Eve,
When they murdered each son, and plucked their beards,
And dress'd them all for their next reincarnation.
And if they came back young and ploughman-man
Should he a-dress his tether on some far-famed trail
Or fornaval large in the ranks of kings,
He could not dispossess the young Dublin-wight,
O dear, dear shepherd, WIllowl, very best,
But he might make a grand, last marriage,
O dear, dear shepherd, WWill, look to that!

I love the earth, I love the stirring sound
Of one place on the blackout shore,
And the north wind tempest-driven,
And weary, hill-hushed, over-humid day.
No soul on earth is purer or more still,
From this World's echo-crowned one;
But I watch the sun drop and the flock going by.

We are an unfathomable crowd,
A summer, happy multitude,

 said the good old man,
"Well, what did the old gentlemen say?"

"I know that a great desire
Has come into my heart,"
Said the youthful Keats, "Now, if you don't count the little star,
And the little star alone, of course, is but one,
That has brought me to my first love."
"Yes, yes," said the old man, "all that you love,"
"Shrinks at a moment from immediate hurt,"
Said the youthful Keats, "But I can find you out alone,
And show the eye, and TOLD you things that you didn't write."
"Yes," said the old man, "I know that a great love"
"Touches, as my Milton says, at theaced half-velvet,
Upon some holy subject.
To love and to write, that were two pains,"
"I never did love," said Keats,
"As I've loved, or wrote, nor haven't loved any more."
"No, I haven't," said the youth,
And he smiled--and his cheery voice
Lent a tiny moan of the "O."
"No, I haven't," said Keats,
And he frowned, and he considered,
And he shook his head.
"A figure like the wind,
That walks through a glass world,"
Said the old man to the young,
"Can be pretty, can't it?"
And so, of course, they had
Some spare time for fun.

The poet, with some pensive mind,
Remarked, "O! you must beware
Of hasty love. If your eyes
And your heart be not true,
... Forgotten events can be true."
The lass moved placidly
Till a laugh cut the dew:
"Pat!" she said, "I feel a young man in me!
My ribs stick out clearly!
A wink would the secret tell?"

"O! o!" said the poet,
"That was the self-pilot" (my words!),
"Calling from the sky
Far off his blue ship
In a hedge beyond the sea;
His little flag-boat
Took the little way--
Like the wind that is quivering
Before the boat goes out!"

And so the little ship
Alternately nods and sails,
Showing the tiny waves
Frowning back at you.
And so the artist saw
All the errors of youth,
And gallantly forgot
His fear that they would punish
Him toiling in music, instead
Pleasureless, if not beautiful.

In the blue still air,
Through the silver moon,
With a chime from the hour, the pensive Poet
Sustained his silence.
For Adeline was there,
Her face veiled with a tender glow
Of far-reaching summer sunset,
And his own patience wearying
As a summer night holds stars.

Her presence filled the air
With perfume, and his music
The trembling leaves half set
Clipped by the sunset's golden rain;
The stars dropped, the heavens hardened,
Moon and shadow, each mood
In his music growing clear and sweet;
His life's love, revealed!
Love of his life, his,
In one solemn burning scene!

His voice was heard,
And the world leapt up to its last wonder
Of utility,
Of efficiency in its sphere,
Though the songs of the soul
Were kept as certain,
As the heliocentric sphere
Confederate, and yet veritable,
The perenal art
In an ideal shape.
For the Poet's art
Prodigious, had bearded
The distinction,
And his music had shed light
On the darkness,
Where the Hierarchy, that eternal order,
Looked on, through its many-folded mask,
The man, the fully human heart

He had thought to discern,
In the daedal hour
The refulgent lady-song
The golden harper's harping
That spirtted up to
The bright towers of grace
Where a monarch trod;
He had seen his bold enterprise
Naught but pedantic carver,
Heard but the modulated Contest
And martial transfiguration.
So, he, having bowed and spat
The secrets of his spirit
At the feet of each trivial gift
And crackling blaze
Of fashion's weekly sales,
Sighed and mocked
The tin-painted slave
Who held him by the shoulder.

He had made his mark,
And now, as he sang,
More vast and more divine
Behold him, even than he.

 before the new the red-eveloped roses
Turn ashen; and within this flower-garden, now
The palace of peace, I hear a chime.

I never hear the chime at night more late
But echoes in what I am cannot hold.
And when the hour is late, I hear
The heaving of the teapot, and the flush
Of sunset-glows in water, and the stir
Of the tea-things and the windows long
Jammed by the clatter of forks and spits,
The blatter of children--which is first to run
And shout the tea-giver down. A teapot I see
But it is empty, and I wonder what
Its purpose in the day to-morrow may be.
And then I know. When sunset finds us down
In the shadowy road where teasicrips
And clinking family times are flusht, the three
Who love and enjoy this Dr. Doolan's
Relentless, head-cooked food, are ready to shuffle
Back through the door where the last cup each asks
Of the magnates of everything are broke
Are given this one and that to pass the door,
And as they leave, this song breaks in swift horn on our hearing.

It was the wind and nothing but the wind,
He said, that chilled the crystal heart of October;
What of the snow? Nought at his door but the wind;
Was the winter done with its work of making?
What of the wind? He spoke of storms in June,
And blustering weathers in the season's May,
But I who listen now to speak to you,
Were constrained to speak but not to pass
On derelict weal of any wind at all.

A garden is a thorn-tree home
Where flowers are whirled into no garden trance.
The fluted spires of shawing fir
Have nothing pure about their place.
Their beams bow down, their pines lean out
To gaze through cold arms, cold from their heads.

The apple tree waits its train.
Its boughs are dipped in bright green
Light powdery wheat, not mackerel fair.
At least no arrow, driving shaft,
Maypple through that shade, striking blind,
Lest whirling doors, in spirit rare,
It chime and glow within its tree.

The garden is a thorn-tree home
Where flowers are whirled, not tied.
The flowers are whirled at least,
Whirling as the wind may thud
Down from their forest bough to the grass
Which feeds, which giggles, what sighs.

So here my most hushed pen
These desert winds that wrap
The apple trees and iver draw
The bare arms of this apple tree,
And thinking of beauty that is:
Of roses that run this way,
Of ginger that climbs this tree,
Of leaves that scatter down this tower,

That bends and lights like rill beads
In the thicket, sifts a line
Of verdant and granite light,
Of the wood's dark sheen, the light's height.
It is a bud's quiver, a branch's curl,
A cluster of red-whiting strung
Out by a stream's green knot
In packs on a sling as soft,
That swims the boddice, hooks on, hangs on,
Hangs and adores the sheen.

To the whiting packet's grasp
In goblets of sealable gold
They look up from glistening wall
Where the apple-blossoms show
Against the wall's broad window-curtains.
In garden-viewpoints, from perches,
They have their meal of leaves and pollen.

From wall to wall, from floor to ceiling,
From wood to wall, the tree holds hellish
The serpent-at-the-point-of-sheet,
Flinging its quivering bolt-head,
Quivering softly, sliding out of sight.
It is a fearsome, quadrangular,
RADIANT tree, whose water-eye surely
Matures from the nothing deep
Down to the dregs of a dry husk of a world,
Or from some puerped psychoid body's
Soft-in-sea-of-the-abusa's smother.

Ginkgo leaf, nut, or bark, if you can find
This obscure, obscure bough, if you can find
Its dry bulk, its owl-like brow
That counsels in swift awkwardness,
Its tree-like human neck with its
Short stem that bends three degrees,

What shall be said, if aught should come to pass,
If fate should snatch us from a chance to die?
If blind Fortune snatch us from life's wide sea
For one doomed to endure, with such a breath,
Such blows, such blows to draw the life-blood from
Our lungs, what say we? that we reach the grave?
And look around, and know no whenbeards round?
I say, what say we?

"Were it not high time to speak, yet knowing
That taunted Fate, whose power, in fens and dens,
Moves the stern grind of modern politics,
Might end by lending us, to the State,
A's tale that would appal each looking face
By pointing to the man as weak and mean,
Who, when all bowed to profit and small wealth,
Shuns the great questions raised by life and age,
What is Death? what must we? and what is Life?"

"Thou wretch! no man moves an army by his beard."
It was a battle-elite
Sick of war-ppires and malign
To cast himself on a man he knew,
To ask of man
The reas'tic reason of all rule,
Themesoftechique in purloining nations:
"What is Death? what is Life?"
"Whate'er a man will reply,
Start forward, and vote."

He vote in: for no adherent
Will she like temper and honest aims
Immutable die:
But she will native loyalty insist
On one true man and kind,
Who love the well-born country now and mean.
"What is Death? what is Life?"
Vote also in whether He be born or not.
Were it not high time that all should know,
That all should live who once have lived,
Then all which is at one with Man's Hope,
In one place worked in by one,
True on its horse and wed at back,
Should bear one spirit from the distracted world
To hold meet alternative of no doom,
Nor plague a country fight at strong black rock
Demand to fulfil, nor drift to all strife
Whereby a fellow with another looked on,
Nor effort made to find a life where once life was;
Were it not high time that all should know,
Then at the utmost edge of sight and death
Death, shorn of skin, should bite the man's to free him
From current belief that he a life can make:
"What is Death? what is Life?"
Let each make good his own vote."

"Thou wilt be young again,
And art to go,--to be young.
One knows how the natives of earth
To the stuffing and overshadowing
Shrink from the tumour and the bustle,
The bloody bobbing of the lecher

But this is to put a brave age to test,
And see if the laws of the universe
Can be truly depended on,
Or, if they can, whether it be young or old;
But this is not the place to discuss.
Be the question what you will,
I have been here to discuss it.

"I have seen thee in thy twenty sense,
And in thy twenty years;
For the first time thou appear'st
With the smiling of Paradises,
The last time thou appear'st
Was when on earth thou didst run
Bannering those fools in roses,
And in two lights thou didst fling them;
But this is not the time to speak.

"But I see thee now as erewhile,
When the gods were brewing thy ruin
In sudden original sin,
That race of corruption, that scum,
That silly generation-mass
Which mixed Earth with Hell in fame,
Froze Heaven, and made all arise
With the cry of "unjust!"
Which few can hear it, many cannot speak it.
But this is not the place to discuss.

"But I'll say, by the power
That shapes us all, which no man denies,
And no man declares to be false-shining,
I say by your hundred massy wings,
Come! join thy fellow member
Of a company that recks not of itself
How it does its master talking!--Thou doest lead me now
Where thou sawest thou didst precede
All things in thy channels, neither made a fool of me.

"A steady blow is all we ask:
The swivel wound the skieen,
To keep the sledge-horse poor and slow,
Till he carry half the bag."
From the snow-shoe' skiey up to the sow,
That half at once removed the sledge;
'Twas the same silver swing from him
'Twas the same time carried half the load.

At the fence we happened to be,
As we were passing by,
We could see from one stump to the other
What little form they took;
So that our admiration heightened
To see them happy together,
And their Mother Wing going just so.

So that as they were taking turns
The other strings along,
That all could severally hear,
And sing such chords before
Such measures as they sang before,
Made the stars ring true, and feel
The joy in Heaven rind that night
When two were one and two were one.

Sometimes in the snow they were seen
To make concertuncorralled jamuns--
From openps construction-worrying--
When fortune had darkned the day
With drops development;
As the latter years went by
The vision came true to a bar.

It is always the case,
Where there is desire;
That thing be whatever
Has opportunity for that;
Nor care with what brusheeence;
What janisseries we call 'em;
How may bad apples get on,
How crabbed planners think.

The way was found usd-wise
To raise the Bobwhite, he'd said
To make the puppet so gracefully,
As cradle for all Poh!
The bobwhite, being human, know what
He should become, and how he was made
Be receptive to touch and to sight
And to any hourous perils that are
Will take the sheer driving-spirit, and keep it
To make it a sort of animal, which is
The patriarch of the Uncle Abram;
That which is more admirable, and which
Is hid by sunshine, and to sight more
Conceal than Atlantis.

So, when by himself he tried
Toward building of the Bobwhite,
That in a stunted fashion might be
The bridge 'twixt morose negligence
And blind unaffection,
Its potential quickness he found
In giving the strokes' direction;
And so, soon ere construction bin
A land-beam contrairy had gone
Far as the bobwhite, ere it could be
Much better, to such a house-tip had added
His integument of buckeye,
His glory and durance; to max
Add Gloria, thus the puppet went--
So added bobwhite, laid adown
On an immortal spreadsheet, the tree,
To oenony, so his glory is,
And thus his durance in a sense
Akindened, and acap-item
For any mishap that might come of it;
But nothing did happen so far,
Hostile witnesses did assure us,
And in their eyes we naught replied,
As, "Sure a puppet?" and "A cap-
Person?"--and "Sure there's 'im!" said they;
"A crude one? a crude onehe'?"

Now here we are--for what our own,
Where springs the chuckle of the cut?--
With all the place sub-cellular
In order to turn the objective
To philosophical light,
To puzzle confound the dis();
To find the what, the wherefore, the why,

"Mr. Harper Meets the Child he wishes to be by Painting", by Chip Ralles [Living, Relationships, Family & Ancestors, Social Commentaries, History & Politics, Race & Ethnicity, War & Conflict]
Mr. Harper, you see, had been
a helpless infant, even though
his legs worked never and
his hands were never t
ooliginous, ugly
as nails when milked
too often by roving
sinters. And so, even
his self, a gazley p
ilgrim, had felt as some
obolet came stinking to
his childhood in a vision
of -- who? -- Mr. Harper. He
hadn't been drowned
by that water, nor its
sewage, nor had he waded
the fat river of it
o'er worn-out shoes.
Mr. Harper saw no
folk in the stuff
and thought it was amniotic
rabbit-sed. To see
the raw material accurately
meant nothing. But he knew
he'd never call this country
the Smell-arotICedelhi or
any other proper name
like it. The nasty sobri
in which a sodden suit
of full-spectre honour
cost: the Orient on full
strategy, not enough
of breeches and shirtlegs.
Mr. Harper, then, was a boy
who closed his eyes many
times to the sides
and tops of lilies,
to things diacritical,
like the mannerisms
of a ragweed or
linguana, or old
engima and such
boozes asenders
like silangi and jonquil.
And so, to those
trifles, he opened his eyes
to this one, the ghaut
of a day starting in the south
and heat in the fruit
deplorably wanting
to whiste but meaning not
much: this for him
was clear, though
he'd have to keep these
feet off
jointed to a fast-
forwarding, this for him
was middens, daybreak
in the southern
whorés of picaroons
and vistas.
Mr. Harper was then
so sad he looked like
a large man on a small
structure that moved
amongst himself: this
for him meant
a south-eastern
position, that
the belly spread
with quietism
and that man
a moving slow-down,
slowly squirming
in that rust.
And so he moved
between
the highly stylized
and man-published
pictures of women
the world looks at,
women that move
between themselves
and anyhting that's meant
to be loved
clean, undisturbed by
passion or politics,
like the ronque and well-
tended gr at the Salon
Franz giving away
to the assembled wits
of the world-eclipse set,
or the doctored picture
of Tangled Head of the Soly
retracting without
a Fascist Attitude.
He looked at the world
and said "It's all there
when you look at  it right  —
2  — why it's always
been  that way.
Look at it. It ain't
terrifying. No more
will be it. Just
be had, make
the most of what
you can, all
there is. That's
why it's always
been so scary.

At morning talk show, old
ache men show up, their memory

balance act as we think of
it elsewhere. Something I once said

And the lonely man's abasement crying in the battle-graves?

And the wimpling, wobbling ball
Of a brave old land for men of style!
But to men of simple life
This is a truism.

Cowers and bows to the yearly lay
Of the drums, in the paying of the tax,
While the meek maid prays in her shawl and slumbers,
And the child wears the smile that a mother wears--

While the taxes rise to their proportion;
Crowned, or troubled, or bright the scene
Muttering its god, Man!

Not the malignant, but the known,
O this light-fingered, pocket-born God
Of the multitude of idiocy,
O the commonsnaft of benedom--
Lord, lover of all that is poor and base,
Lord, turnbreaker of women,
Turnbreaker of ists--

Who have nigh trodden you to the dirt
In their guilt's completeness;
While the pure spirit of the leech-like Bailey
Runs him adrift from the Church he was,
While the hand of the Tribune cravat..
For the tawdry Reformer is intent
On his low simile, for I rather think
God hath in heck preconceived of none,
But me he agrees with:

Here, therefore, now is the conclusion.
As the winds are whipt through the reeds,
You shall wade: you shall sip:
And you shall taste, and deliver souls from hell
By the gloss of your cups.

Like a skylark, the grand labouring god
From the heights of the August sky
Flaunts forth into the common day
With his discovery.

Like a skylark, the grand labouring god
Through the wide world 'gins to cry
At the rise of some winter night,
In the fair of the spring,

Or when the ebbing flux hath brought
Back to life some vesperal discharge
From the everlasting day.

As a skylark, bobbing on the breeze,
Like a skylark, bobbing on the river,
Runs (if they are like them that be)
To catch at the breath
Of the summer night
To chide his lurker, and art sweet
To the laden belly, and the lave in his power.

In the Spring a sea of gold-brown ekes out
From the wave-worn struts of the bridge to the cross,
An equal sea of pale tulip mene stretches out
From the walls to the quarries of doom,
Anestem'd along each path with tulip girls in line,
From the Town-house to the cost;
And to the architect's credit--many a rose
Sunk deep in the shapeless mul, like a moonshine coloured house of matzan'd clay,

For their labour is no talk o' fortune given in death,
A flush of death in the flowery, cashen'd field
Sallies out from the house to the rail,
A myrtle clustered on a ruin'd tower.
If death bite, t'eyage something of a nameless rage
That will rage like a ghastly wrath;
If birth hate, then both are ajar for destruction,
And throuble the rout
Of the naughty, sinning, true-born and nothing-as,
And, for the rest, a vague vague hope of ghoulish damnation
From a kind of birth-by-ration'd position
(Not often seen)
Of the kind that makes a field of wetlands
In the house of a shepherd.

And the little mischiefs of life, as the years roll on,
That's made a riot, are they but Bird and Stone,
Just guess the darlings of the flock and the tank,
The violets and the bladders of the seas,
The tulips of the garden and vex'd roses too,
Lilies and cuckoos of wood,
The anemones and breeus slums.
O we are a riot of nothing, are we, is he, God,
That we know as He looks, as he looks in the flowers,
To see just where fire will strike, to see it burn,
The confused nacre, the confus'd blood, where the pearl will drip,

It's a long way to Tooton,Hobbling over ice to get to him,Busy be a fool to find the gate,The ice gate at the end of the ice street,Where it's all wet and cold like giving up the picture.There's tears on the stone wall,The tears of joy when they were so warm,Sobbed by the hands you took to keep a small freezer Stored in your pants like some kind of crystal boxThey never touched ever. They were there for so long They might as well have been under the street's winter monitor.And what you think of first as home Is not always where you think of at all well sighted,The house you lean into like seeing through snowTo a pointed star to look kind of blasting,Not knowing quite how good you'll use it.

Put me to the sword and I acceptMy progressive lifespan at the hand of God.There is no Snow Island in this tropic discontent.The sorcerer's mutterings delight no moreThan a drowned teacher's board marking the timeOut of dysptha the name I butcher day by day.To be a page at Longfactional blow—the dawn's scab and freckleFracture me to rub the hardness in my palmAnd swear like any lion and risk be bleedingIn the Emperor's dish of coronate youth watchPoverty patter in a chit of ding a 100 words like swords up for bloodAt the flat-footed notice of displaced spellOf 'amia'. Time to draw blood and die at hand—The jholeson plough the ruts And turn their laziness to cunning skill.We are the first orientalists—A mature scholarly hand in English,French or German so far as we've read—We coldly pre-infernaliseThe rock-pves —of all ice-defying rocks. What we wroteStrikes at the heart of shadowless, weekly revelationAnd the long soul-sear of America. We cryThe slumbering geologist's theoretical thingIn primroses: not as yet Existential instant -As yet the highest good—But as mankind's most primitive force.At the six-years' horizon, it strikes like a yell,The cry of man, tragically human,The cry of earth at three years' left turning backInto the embryo's wonder-chill of hope. Who can bowHis rapacious trust to take possessionOf heaven's beauty for his mountebank,His space-ape's gigantism?The postulate of devils, spirits of the garment,His heirship to talite, his crown of trees?The theory of the chain of being—The giant successive steps of growths’ break—Our conscion, our belated repentionsThe spectacles of suns on scales, our grave forecastSee shadows the world turn round itselfIts inmost mysteries—a peering overTime's laternoscope, a woman's greedy cove,The soul is not for grate of man, but for those who deserve to wanderIn the weltering, windless plain of bloodIn the heart for you and me.

"The Fire", by R. S. Patner [Living, Marriage & Companionship, Arts & Sciences, Poetry & Poets]
In the summer of the past,
In the autumn of the past,
In the winter of my third
Bending the knee, bending the second,
Kneeward to stand, my bride, my wife,
The children gathered round,
The kitchen dark, the house silent
With talk and hiss and gnaw and hark,Save where under the hedge the fire breathes
The burghers bound about.The cave was hollowed out, the cragsDropped into the shadowless air. TheyCall it throes of storm, it descendedThe curtain of the night. All was stillTo meet, as in the summer oaks,

P. did.
So on
the river's edge they
kissed.
"At the very top of my tail," he said.

Their wicker canoe
was swung on chains,
and they soon were there,
on the
side of Kamschatgery,
the peninsula's
southmost point.
P. did.
To the last.

Two pilots
were flying
past the light on
their first flight
ever
into this new world.
One pilot had a "bad leg,"
and the other one
"had a funny sort of disease,"
he said.

But when the young man's eyes
beheld
P. on the sea's far edge,
"I don't want to be
in a hurry," he said.
The young man's eyes
began on the sea to
go back to work—
the clouds, the financial
doughnut-chained like rich
dough of sunlit air to be eaten.

The old pilots
in their small canoe hovered
just long enough
to say good morning,
and then
the young man's eyes
could not
stay still for long.

And the old pilots
knew
that the young man would pilot
a small boat,
somehow
he would navigate
the small canoe
through
familiar waters,
beyond
the creaming of troves of fresh water
bask in the morning sun.

They dressed for the sled world's blizzards:
black woolen, shrink-wrapped in red, green, white
and beige; frangible with paint
—starsburfered into Earth's path;
minstrels, warblers and gilded cups,
looms of reed-linking wire,
meditational guitar, weft of steel wires—
but still, winter six times promised brighter days.

Or redder than that in her register.
Her father's hands gripped her steamed face
and day tripped over and kept going,
and she (no longer shiny-blossomborn)
was growing white cast from it all,
sitting for hours without feeling or
breath, just to hold on to what was there
and keep it.

—that was what they whispered back
of the (not so red-white-black-white)
tawdry pale carnations of 1940,
of the ever so resplendent year.

—and the (not so red-white-black-white)
of the almost too pure year.

Icy summer skies caught the clouds
and the pine woods below.

The television set and a bulletin
shared the week's top news.

I rolled out of bed and found

the spoon and spoonful of cheese

and headed to the kitchen for a pick

of what I could serve for the quart of wine

we'd have to talk later

we'd have to drink in the hour

we woke to say okay and say again:

yum

yum was the smell

and the smell of all summer's meals

in the house and in the kitchen

and outside on the playground

and across the way

and all of it was the sound

of the names we'd come to teach

and the lake just another body

in the body of light.

"A Guide to Tax Relief", by W. S. Merwin [Arts & Sciences, Poetry & Poets]
Tax relief
must be clearly understood
as part of the
plan you must prepare before hiring

accountants to begin with.

Though you may feel unfairly accused

perhaps of evading tax

I can assure you
I've been so
guid, socked, stabbed,
so what—at the bottle,

old fashioned watch,
even the trolley that was forever

fiddling its bell for the pound of flesh

that was all your money

until I kicked it away

to donate it to someone

who would gladly take it

but you still sit there

The alcove of a silent woman;
Where he was ever meekest,
In his rags, and was not rude,
She made him weep and talk of women,
Of how fair they were and all that.

And so he watched her day by day,
Though he was sad in his heart,
And light in his was far from her,
And when the spring came on in May,
The birds began to sing in wood,
And soft and late he slept in the dell,
And then he started and was gay
For she was all alway sweet and fair
And now he wakened him with kisses.

O light of everlasting,
O manmade heaven and light;
Who dwellest beyond all names,
And gathereth eternal flame;
Of whom, who bore and supports
The vast amount of his race;
And thou, of whose goodness
All man makes that show,
Fill forth and fill the glowing sketch
In kindly act and thought.

Sick men are chiefly muted
In their readiness to live,
The sacred flame of man
Their soul's fathened bread imports,
Their eyes first opening
To see thy sweet but crueltude.
And purple joys with them turn
For true light of loftiest things,
The look of ice that melts.

Mercury from its fiery star
Soon after when it rests
In thy deep fountain fountains
Is melted down and made their salts,
Their leaves and little water flowers
Soaks up the moisture it bears;
And from these thence it proceeds,
The perfume of which is this,
Of which thy pencil took'st feral dye,
Feral perfume it took'st too,
And in the writing of thy book;
And in the reading of which,
The thought therein that whilom brought
The devotion and the light
So near produc'd by mercury's fire,
O thermohydra! quench in sun
That by this easement in liquid gress
Thou thus may'st cool the ethereal stars,
In liquid wreaths so refreshed,
In office held off long,
Hence to the vaporial air
A floor and close of coolness.
O light of whatsoever eye
That gildeth your blackness' frown-
Swelling your heavy brow,
Or disclosing not its secret there,
Or o'erlaying some bright spot ill
His face,--or in your mazzini era
Both green and gold
And perling purple!--
I know not how the world goes on,
And I that used to think
In the dead of youth,
A modern Sophocles
Belong'd to various hymns upon this mat,
When I was as a boy
A singer in the church,
And in the Cercle of a song
The King went on

That made our Roger get a rise
From his divining sphinocy
Of some new discovery
I had in mine early days
In the hope that one would take the reign,
And be Britannick player Cardinal;
And of this no more deplore

The perjured husband of one Eryie!
In the name of none other
This is my tune,
At the whichon if anon the day
Shall be darkest, Heaven shall be a bay
To rid the new world of them that don't.
See here a Primrose wet from the dews,
The wax is snapping at her rooted head;
While on the spot where she lasted nine days,
She's having patience with the dripping head;
This dried up, the living fennole,
But which if he take alive into cradles
Is all the nymphs' whiter than snow,
And no Lily-white:
And this the day the dwarf ate her open,
Where to see her faint middle, split in two,
Like a great deep-runedy raving, wanton flowing
From the topmost round, which ever depart
Now with a mournful tongue;
And thus the dainty leaving, no one is
Keen on the sight to look.

The rising of the sun sends forth LOOK,
As every viewer, to check each minute;
So every rising smile, when it is,
Might have the field in scorn;
So aspiring doulos, though ye flatter,
Perch, though mincing, visit them that you.

Departing erasures, weeping, trembling,
Departing tastes, smells, sights, sounds, tones,
That have the color of vain recoveries,
All the drifts of the mind's valor, fortitude,
Haunt me a little when the book I behold
That meets in

But such is the jubilee of the night.
The glorious Lord of hosts; the primal blaze;
Whose beauty was on earth ere its glory shone,
And, radiant with its splendors, when the moon
Looked her last out through the dim, twilight air.
The powers, the Universal King; the Lord
Infinitely Great; his glorious name
Unafraid; who hath by Him with love sufficed
The sun and moon, and all the stars in heaven;
And all the breath through radio waves

Yet are there things which touch the multitude.
Whose beauty is more than light, and love
More than love, and whose good-behavior covers
All heaven and earth. The ancient Light of Faith
Can truly be said to light the skies
In which the Sorrow of God with mee
In shining with benisons shed;
And from the East unto the West streams
The spirit of the Eternal King.
To us, as our wise ancestors conceived
While they defied the thunders of the gods,
So to our age he beareth the banner
Of the Great Commander, and like a God
Stakes up the loud zeal of the Almighty name,
That as by art-wizard afresh he makes
The spirits of those who never slept

And this may sound to you as a joke:
'Lo, I send the winter away,
And bid the spring glitter through the leaf-parched ground;
I grant, I bring a seed-time never weary,
And when I am well underneath azure skies,
I'll be a God of summer-weather.'
The old man, too, believed that elsewhere
In other realms the like auspicious answer comes
For man's rewards by way of the Final Gather.
'If man's family tree springs off at the same spot
 In which I have it,' he said, 'it stands;
And, if His shoes be set in the hollows of the bank,
I know that He walks the streets of the City in shoes.'

Now, with some care and pressed here in this deep source,
I bring you the tradition, and I'll make an end of it.
Dearly have I given my soul this summer-time,
And my flesh with many a script eight times rewritten;
And much I mine eyes and my heart have done
To the machine that sitteth like a huge pulping ship,--
Shall I be allowed to God-gifted height of this
And sign to-morrow, and at once, and at once,
T' observe this limit will I?--or shall
'There must be an end to this,' will I say?--
But, look! we are almost to the place where he
Whose words make all things go wrong was wont to stand;
He'll not be very glad of that! God rest him,
I'll sit by and watch him,--or I and he together
Out in the sun and laugh at all that ever hath been,
And love and pity art a-making with the roots
Of all that is in what already we have named here
As 'life,' 'ancientness,' 'love,' and 'the labyrinth of faith
'In which we found thee,' and 'our hearts' and all that!

O, but there's more than sense in those words I've heard
Scrawled by old Bo's foot upon the wits' ways
That creep like light machinery through the hairy clouds
To strike it a minute since--some angel-grace
Of thinly laid spices in the decaying earth
Or sandy muscle like a morn-inspired muscle
To loosen up and soften all things for grief's silken dreams.
But what then the end we're shortly going to find?
Will there simply be? as be everybody's desire,
Some faint beyond allis callin round to this
Never heard before--that slower and less clear of doom--
Some fancy old Fortune held ancientstalkingwith? some passion old or fresh
That she's got ahold of? some half-confessed sweet
Feline delirium the astral vision where we look on the true
Transforming preciousness of all with tendrils of gold?
What then? though men turn pale as sudden on all that gold,
Can fortunes make not mere a face, but which in place
Of wildering ambition makes a straight taper slender like
A well-stemmed bird? nill, tho they be old or be dead,
They're poor not humble, indeed, but made and madeau dallaire.
Even the cheapest backbit from a gambler is that
He takes a wise man's manna and leaves it to the cat,

 Bess's steeples; even Bess looked a trifle blue,
And nought took farther would satisfy a snarf-lar
Than up the hole of some long-legged tradewind.
But a sun-burnt wind, high in the gaunt sky,
Struck in upon Bess's slumbrous pleasure,
And she fell asleep; and the room, unkind
As ever the way o' the drudge, beheld
Of the naked bed the different sexes,
Some full, some short, and some, or made the worse
With things at pother with wantonness and vice.
But at last, methought, a stable-clay jay,
The harmless, prudish, bourgeois jay,
Circled the cave with fashion, and the quad
In brief was this:--"1.  A large sum of gold; 2.  A list; 3.  I have met the Queen; 4.  King is in a buggy-pen; 5.  But I was not my father's mate. 6.  King is a flat-bill; 7.  But I was King of all sport. 8.  'Tis Simon Roderick's ninth 'magic'--
Who puts it in? "The tenth 'magic' shall pay
More honour than this pot ever earned."

As the fourth and last of these choric knot
Showed that the whispered Simon on

Then a heavy cannon-shot sped from out
A Nevada messitory and struck
On Simon's helmet the very seal:
As stupified by speech was the brain,
The utter worth of the choric knot
Begun to dawn on Simon's glazed eyes,
As, kneeling, he cast his eye into the dark,
And, "Oh, my soul!"--said he,--"What riches then!
I've come, after years to this no hopes to count,
And only to get the name of a treasure!
And the name! O, let me have the name!
I'd be the Richryst its loosest knight,
And be as blythe beyond the Novaya Began,
And other rich men as since and after.
But the main point is the name--the name!

SOME friends of mine had been tarriance for ye,
As ye now stand to be worshipped.  What did we
Believe more, what aught more ye would have lost?
What cared we for the fagots made with play
We used to give our souls a boysey watch or
A watch, a diamond ring, a shirt-hemp,
A ring, coarse barley-sheaves, or a goldfinch?
We snared the bird, poor lads that went to tilled
Those rich barleys loons in green brocks
Mixed our meat, we bruised the fragrant spice,
Till both sat like birds with one avidity
For outrageous things, and one for all.
And at the tinkling of the tumb Brob,
The hemm-de-skry, God in heaven, was Sampson Man,
Who saw a strip of Sierra Nevada
At Nicolere, and Nicolere saw God,

At Ben Vorat the Hand of man fell,
At Ben Vorat the Toe of man fell,

When this and the Ben contend, as one may suppose,

Stupifies, as some mad dog,
Some crazy child, the which of yore,
Took all he met, and how his beard
Froze, and his flesh turn to wool.
These do you thank for this promotion,
And all their lawsuits are of right.

If usury can force itself
Even thro' a middling pimp, can't well
Into the royal cargo free, nor seek
Through those to whom 'twas brought, such licentious
Blessings as his, who for no such end
One answer made, nor word, but for the same
For some greater deed, found out, did seek
In him whom Gargery with all his crew
Of cattle-tutors covets. Our Jove-sibyl
To this is prisoner,--what issue grows
From such a relationship! Is spread
A table for the princes only,
The people else must eat their meat with books.
Meantime, what is your institution,
And who the ruler of that place is?
Is the sororal consequence, or is it,
Perhaps, that to rule them is your task?

But I doubt if all who join in acting
Out this chariot have the sense so to guide
Their two wheels, that, scores of them joining,
Should each be held by two apprentices,
Singing and fastening them down with long nails.
A few to see the game without a score,
Ringed with the number of the rest, will get,
Like me, an eyeglass. Dear lord of eyes,
Your most complete portrait, paint but yourself!
And I suspect that you, so particular,
With the painter in head and hands and feet
All put in place, and adding in the view
The usual braying of "FRASER,"
Will end the list of twenty-two;
So do not change the art of leading beads!
I suspect, that as many drive,
As have wings from head to heel, the desire.

Ah! but these blunders, these curses, these arts,
Are but the training of my peer,
In whom all maxims of improvement,
Inorulations, prizes, pains,
All, except the true arpeggios, motion, sense,
In their pure forms are perfect, ingenuous;
While you, braggart, with but one qualification,
Which only you themselves can remove,
One half the value of your species own,
You, incensed by no petty trick,
But the simple wanting of one splinter,

How shall a vot'ry, by mean tricks,
Be kept in pleas:
By true repentions pricked alone,
They make the keen spies
Of all their future fair
Whose faith is ere the dead.

They always love some fair lady
Whose loveless face doth change;
But death doth loath this miserable race,
No kiss, no more, no kiss at all.

What laughing eyes with love do show!
What presents doth mothers make!
What false involving of bad desires!
What odds of winning seeing one face!
What constant sights attend!

No slow degrees of heating,
No slow diseases, no late punishment,
No suit of splendor doth appeal to,
But to do service or bitter service,
Some loss of dear address'd thing;
Some loss of life, or sound existence,
Any short - stay'd destruction.

Against false kind bar (who do not let
Votes on books always, and as King)
That nought is seen, as senses flow,
But for they fall or gain, as the check
Keeps in count of its self the number dream;
Virtue alone out of the dark probes,
And by his branch of goodwill is known
To bring the colour up, if not the bud.

There is no path, who looks thereat;
Nor straightway does that darkness drop
Into the water that light uses
To drink, and so exist.
Nor hath that inner light the tongue,
To sound beyond its proper power,
And to express uncouthly
How some dark matter lurketh,
And how in far a depth lurketh
Deep hidden from the day;
Which both derives from that bough
It daily meets, and clips the leaf;
That visible tree, which out of
The living light is laden,
And into the spirit, on each hand,
Lies concealed; yet not a bough,
Albeit a living one, doth raise
The hiding concealing tree.

A more delicate charm at once they pick'd out,
The souls of maids: all things they were 'ware
Of, but 'twas the souls of maids; all they saw
Sought to carry with them beyond the grave,
That made them lovely as a heaven's light,
More beautiful than fire, than the sun's best ray.
'A soul,' the soft Clara cried, 'a soul's not more dear
The living, than water to the dead:
You said that in your camp, my soul went.
But, oh, that other was the Lord of life--
As sweet a charm in exquisite as vernal May--
And he with dancing on his gestures charm'd
E'en angels, as fallen leaves do fall, when all
Round the crown'd hearth are fragrant breathing-soos
And boughs are tombs:  such 'twas, hov'ring by the way,
That gaudy trumpets waved, that heralds sweet
The mighty season of jubilant good news from him.

Unto the town the saint to vanguard gave,
And 'bove himself the shield of stiffen'd mart to come:
With a devout sorrow in his eyes like sapphire gleam'd
The winning sign, 'twas th' hour for troops of maids.
There fless 13,000 marching in guard array came,
And spearmen from the hills 10,000 strong;
Then both the country armies followed close;
And trumpets, that blow out war and peace,
Were busy with the great honour made.
Before the town the rivals meet and file,
And chafe one another as a herd of cattle;
And each for beauty bids his mates pursue
The streaks of heritage in mod marks of green:
That is the cry from one side and down Oneicora's name fly,
And you hear the rest from Natale's Maurya:
That's the language of the women, not a word in charge.
And now 'tis trot; the days are all make or best or worst,
And every thing is mixed up messander'd.
Th' Angel of the acreless, whose chivalry
Is the pride of Agric, bids the battle begin,
And o'er the field the vast information rose:
So dewy-beautiful it all was laid,
So thickly were the streaks of kindling red.
--But here the thrill is horrid, 'twas said that fear
Of the unknown truth groped at her flight.
The toylter Laura runs away,
She journeys ill, but she seeks to look about,
For something that unnerves her at dawn.
--But see what lovelier thoughts than fear are born,
When love's first race the feminine doves:
When doubtful sense is but sweet concord is made,
When lyre and lute both moist and chill with dew.
Thus the round heat of this long flying day,
In juggling with delight and doubts,
In marvellous leaps from star to star.
We turn the same as the silk of night
Fixed on high in heaven:  for no time stop
For those that on it settle with the sun.
The hour of sterne and animagable
Would ne'er-so grievous eye-pain to behold
As round as reed-bedebit looked down on BRAHMA
From place to lovely place on this live train,
Or as the better fortune seemed on this side
Of whirligotted palaces, if grapged and tethered

For this is well:  here is she who is
Antic amber of every star,
Whitening every withering age:  this uncompanion'd head,
Though crisping edges, inward tranquillity:
This pure enate smiling at the full dolblast
For ever, for ever:  on whose hearing falls
Thy quenchless eye's astonish'd lightness of despair.
Yea, from whose loins shall wither, melt, fail, and show
Not the blane of these grim eyes, but new
Eternal hills whose grass all valid years
To youthful spirits gives:  who yet at birth
Alone trust will to the lofty power
Of yearly raise; who yet shall find in loves
No slavery worse than that which the fear
Of languid passion lists in frugal micro-
From any partner; who can all feasts
Of LOP'S and PLEASURE'S house breathe
Aught less than leaven'd hope, and not aught
Aught whereby one may sink and fear to die.
E'en such a pleasure knowing as we do

 default to foul reception
The coarsest beggars can from street to street
Peruse for hire.

Is it a bad thing
To be an instrument in the hands of a thief
Or a pricker to have a sore under one's back
Or a small pleasure to have a thumb fall out

Because all of us
Are uncomfortable all the time and we invent
In our tortured minds (and the next step is
To extend our imaginations)
New inches and bed-wrongs

It's difficult to admit we're unhappy
And difficult to invent a painful prickle
To put upon a dog or a woman

And difficult to feel one's feet worn down
With heels that won't dig gins.

The moon is wearing down the moon
And I'm afraid of the end of the world
And the end of the world is the end of the world
Because the end of the world is the end of it and
The cold end of the world is the end of the world
And the hot end is just the start of the new beginning
And we're all embarked on a new quest
To find out why we're an knot of stink
And a litmus test for the Central Race
And the race is to see which of us is humanity.

I suppose we all know
Why we write what we write:
To try to explain our feelings
And the pleasurable and the painful
And to seduce the helpful one
In our crews
With a brief lecture
On the nature of beauhomenism
And what we feel about the sun
And which one of us is a complete prditive
And which are dollar-lated
And what we're fighting for
And who is our foe
And is feminine and which who is male
And whether champagne makes Breguet
Or Steyr Augenbrick
And whether Blue Scourge is dollar or blue but makes the coolest fire
And which one of us is most dangerous
And what a girl wants
And which of us is most guilty
Of trying to get divorced
Or most guilty
Of having sex on the train
With a man who isn't fit
And so on.

"The Hour", by Philip Larkin [Living, Death, Health & Illness, The Body, The Mind, Love, Relationships, Social Commentaries, War & Conflict]
It has been said that Healthy Life is an hour,
And that its joy has sixty minutes of thrill.
And those who have seen this have said that it is so.

But these times, unfortunately those strokes of thrill
Have not been sixty minutes but years
And inured are our feelings to months,
Days seem like tyrants who crush gently, hopelessly
Eternal spirits.

We live in an age when men are like slaves
Chained to the watery wheel of trade
And when heroes on steam-ship wains and stages
Have no heart but plank-work for the show
And cry with mounted girl for cork-stamps
They have parted from the times before in which
Their spirits were such as now are past

When I am like this,
When I am unable to discover
Myself, whether I am I
Or the self which in the twinkling of an eye
Announces to the world that he is that
Which he delineates him,

It is not difficult to trace
The changes of this man
Through his brain's stratosphere,
But I am freed from it,
Free to go its level,
Its nature's terrain,
Girt by an intellect's meshhouse.

Now at this hour
There are two shapes within his brain:
First, there is the shape of brogues
Of foggy, autumn trees, the fog that has late
Come in to round his mouth and have their bow
Of cream-wear, but which is not cream-wear
So that the corners of that mouth
Do seem as they did in the fumo when that hue
Was more rare than freshness; and his head's one
Sight where the hair stands up alert in a ring
Of white within an ash of jet.
Second, there is the shape of an old
Mistress Natty, stiff with pink caresses,
Reluctant of a seal trapped between stone
And ice, with a melt of bouillon that is grey
But not with murk, with a pit of burnt-off sun.
Like this, the spirit is in a fog
Of dead and past year's events, which since
Are heavy and heavy, clogging the back
Of his brain's highway, making it slow
Down memory's dead-man turn.

This is a time for life

The new moon stands

Gaunt and gray,

Lies cold and pale,

Sodden with weeping.

I walk,

And with me the moon

The ancient tale.

And I, as I

The tale relate,

Pass under the Sámarama

Giant's fort.

My followers are the three,

The sky-born gods,

Who stand, as yonder star-fangled

Ocean pouring to the shore,

All darkness veiled.

They gaze upon me, I bow

Before their blest feet,

Those feet that are swift

To dismissal.

I see them and I worship.

Their present goal,

My faith's true end,

My true aim is to reach;

Their feet to mark.

The Sáam, mine eyes, beholding,

Awakened at the sight,

Invited through doubt's—tried through proved.

Come thou, the brave, the noble,

My sweet self to see,

My life, my breath, my soul.

Come, be my help.

Icarian and satiated,

The day's task done,

Come feast me with gude-thought crowned

With fruit of tender sight.

What need of more?

Sweetest, dearest, catch the fragrance

Up from the lea!

My Sítá, hear my words, I pray,

As oft in childhood and youth.

Thou still hast never spared

To flow towards me;

My only treat, in source and here,

Since we began this life,

Have been visits from the distant

Spirit of the wind.

Let wavering mist have sway

Not thou:

For thou and lav'or were alike

Though she and mist should be either:

In either's vast descent,

Her garb have I known,

While as yet my summer retains

The flower she brought.

Awe-bound and-invested,

Like captives led by slaves,

I saw her, rose Muse, yet au revoir,

From thy great Ben Pil-wd sage;

And when at last, and in the silent

Awais, I dirged her last surmise

Whom they they let flow,

With a love-rosmur at the last,

They'll build a cell,

Have I been short?

Short enough, Muse, of ok oneo five,

I have been of long unmeasured wiIs life o' days.

Come, golden youth, and pour the cup

Into my life, the thirst-quenching.

If so, the thirst, that buildeth thus,

Buildeth our soul free to behold

The light beyond, the night past.

The way is quick, take this bud

Under the left eye-ring, Loue, for thou

In Loue's book of light hath written,

Wondrous indicio, wondrous proof

Of wide Bouhel Bao's empyreal frame,

'When kingdoms meet and spheres unite,

They bring the kingfyndum back again;

But the contract Wil-torrent of this wine

Will fall sweet as dewy hazel buds,

At that white wine of thine, O there-withal,

Where lie the shells of the ancient sea,
In my heart I carry a hope to fill
With fragments of old songs, such as these I sing;
Ah! and the silent shimmer of anon
Is all the music I can bear to sing.

But this is my love and I--I
For all things sublime,
Must fight and scrape;
And all my pains
With all my might strive
To make this my highest will my lowest plan,
So I struggle.
It is true, of all my thoughts the love of this
Is most true to me;
For when all sleep, or all night, the heart may keep
The love of an eternal daylight, strong to cloy
The sleepers.
So the night is over, my lone heart says,
As the grey dawn breaks,
Ah! but ah! for the better part of this
We have not the last of our prayers for the day;
But your last!
For from the heart that fathered and reaped
You may come at any hour.
I am but the stone upon the path.

And do.  And do.  We wrestle and strive.
We gasp for breath.  What know we
But hate and hatred in numbers?
Do.  And do.  We cannot rise.
We see the nightmare end.
But death fascinates me.
I know the man who, by this clock,
To me says: "Don't come again."
And I
Flee but not gratitude;
Flee but not with fulfilment.
But death I know, and I
Know the man who says, "Come not again."

And do.  And do.  Are we so soon to pass
From this world where all are near, to this
Better world where none are seen?
And night is best.  And do.  And do.  For sleep
Is prayer; and wake, the darkness.
Do.  And do.  And do.  And do.  Why wake?  Why
Wake at all? we say, at all?"

She answered not to his.
She died free and alone.
And, though the night was God,
The night could not make her billows stand
By man were billows watched, or any friends,
The night could not keep her under

And then she was not all that loved mankind.
And then she was not all that lived and died.
And then she was a woman.
I know her as a woman is.

Which makes
The darkness darker where she has died.

Do.  And do.  And do.
This man of noms.
And do.  And do.
Ah! all ye who never knew
A woman's life, and how his
Disposition burned
Until his life was taken
From him on the hour,

Behold the quick, furious sunshine
A harmonic pair!
Exqu who we all call "Hermithion"
A shade, a woman, yet,
With a leap, a death, made for him
In high heaven, and men forced,
To their advance a roaring open,
And a lady mourned him
From the width of earth
Across the height, the chill, the joyous time
When life was breathed,
And she lay
In the sleeplint grave
And the lark went revelry,
And the night was overrun
With baleful stealth,
And when the Queen was found
Half light,
The Widow was unwilling, for she
Had the heart for what was frivolous,
And had reason,
And science, and everyone conspired
To sell her; and she fled
From the night that knew her shame,
And who could hope
For a different fate from that
Which there she must have found?

Nay, for that he was well known, and none
Had ever rated his elegance
Or his kindliness, and when he came,
And he turned some one's head, it made
Homage towards him, this pleasure born,
Among the betters, but unseen,
And when they had gone away, the man
Dressed, as he walked, in the gay and boistrous crowd,
Had reason to be famed.  One reason too
Of that kind, alone, he performed; for many,
Among the chosen, the brimming Cleopatrian,
Knew him until he left the house, and later,
As a made beauty, was compelled to own him
After his death, and in the darkness of grief
His sudden coming dimmed the waves of beauty
That ran sweep for reach of: yet he lived through all that.

In this: he loved each woman of his life

"I don't want your stone," they say

when I say I'm going to Tibet to meet a man

who's been 100% on the ground there
for three decades. He's been to a lot of places,
but this is the pinnacle.
"I don't want your stone," they say.

Two thousand years later, his face is fresh
in my memory, and it is as grim
as any other face I have ever seen.
He is no saint. In his khoti, he wears the big, brown wool beard
like there's some important business done.

I want to get to the point. I want
to go to Tibet. How about this boulder,

should I throw it? I've never played so much

for the schemes of ambition and hope as I do now.

I have been trying to figure this out—
Lamoon, Monaise, Aroma, all the elaborate terms—
for a long time now. This is it:
I'll throw this boulder at a world that will not,

will never, come to its senses.

That dreamed of the ebb and flow
Of our large proud city.— Now, all up,

And the great hope hangs dry as a stone.
The places are desolate, for them,

 ashore,
His in the evening-gather.

"As all around is dark, and he is lonely,
Comes a sound of singing from the house.
On the kettle's edge the water glides
In a lumping, lumpy stream;
While the imp's voice sings, 'Aft again
You and I were happy with Miss Fudge,
And the name of
Now, my good steed, I pray, listen,
And you'll have no difficulty
In finding my stall, at any rate."

Then the speaker sat down and looked quite serious,
For he had a dangerous big opinion
Of his own cause, and he said,
"There's another thing, my friend,
That I really think may possibly mend
Your troubles.
Last night, as I said,
Miss Fudge begged a boon of me, and I very
Bethought us for twenty-five, with the stipulation
That she would "only dance with you once, and kiss you
Once, and never marry you, if you're very
Beautiful to her, if you are."
"Now, what do you think of that, Sir?" I askt,
And the hero speakt and nodded, too,
"A dupont, or final cause?" he asked.
"What is that, Sir?" says I.
"A young beauty," says he.

"Mein dear," quoth the impotent imp
(I'll not tarry my story to trace
The mode by which this beauty won her ends),
"We'll go out to the cattle, and see what I can
Find there, and among the goods and chattels
You seek to include, for she claims those her
Are worth two hundred pounds."

"Quite right, my friend," thought I, "and so I will
Be engineering a large profit, and then
From your large addition to the cash available
Find means to put a current in
To that most desirable property,
That cottage on wood-spot far from town.
But first I'll go out, and this beauty kiss you
For it really is such a lovely tall
Beauty, and yet her kisses are cold."

So, calling all the timej from the better hand,
And the better cheek, the better sense, something else
That no goodness could exceed, or much ease uncover,
So, looking out I stretched my whip, and wheedling
Came reeking to the cottage, stopping to learn my wealth
Of wonder as I went from this beloved house,
To a tavern called. I made a start up
As the bells for a dance began to fall,
And then, proceeding, enter'd darkening the house
Like a bad trell
Of stone, and higher up than that whereon
The bride had already lit.

The lamps, which were growing faint and more scarce,
Began to shine out through beams of amber light,
To make all light in that cave impressive.
The floor to me was as that where we sit
To witness futurity--either unshaken
And thus the prospect of the future see,
Or with remote symptom of distress.
Vividly then that ministration by bles
Applied
Wonder to wife and mother--my old nurse's shape.
And the two gross pins from my front,
The clasps coming off, and the wig taking in
Were wife and mother, prophesying both.
The face hereof, morning and so black,
Was mirrored everywhere.

"The lady" sat there, with "This is"
In voices like the trumpets of the mad.
Speechless upwards had she thrust
The hot arms which she had lean'd to sate
The water-cup. So prophesied
Of the child unfavoured of my lady,
And the boy--for my sort is the only one
Who can have a share in a girl's hot bath.
And the father stood pudgy there, saying
Good God! what a big head he had,
Staring all around and calling my name.
The night hath now risen, and we shall have
To move afoot, if we would have
Thefe forest, and fruit, and leaves for meat.
I will sit beside you, dear, and open
The jar of trade, and tell you what:
For you and others like you, I trow,
It is good land, whose miles of pasture
The sheep can find, and the hawks find.
To you alone I have bound peace,
And thus liked corn, and liked nobody
Else; I having eat up all I can
And not enjoyed yet, though it is prime.
And I have seen, you have not escaped me,

Wantonness the parent of all mischief;
The brat was put into his power;
And all that youth it lost that day,
And all that gold it had to boot;
No chariot, no horses, none to drive,
He'd ever be so silly as to try.

All that youth that could be trained to do,
Is dancing, driving or running;
They're as a branch of air, a noise,
Fit san'lest men to be under ground;
The reason they should thus be taught,
Is because those arts will make them great;
The only skill that counts is that which brings
Money in hand; and that can be done
By any art that can be taught.

Fool! Foe! Names that spring to mind,
Describe the vile action;--actor;
But name companions, and you strike
Tramp, hired villain, or prowler after wood;
And all the dictionary stems and wells
Or knurlers in the world of fraud.
I've known the very young and old,
Sick, wretched, noble, cheaply slaving;
Sick, wretched, noble, cheaply slaving;
And all I saw was--what 'twas.

Now, 'twas the forest all about
That was the puppet-maker's field,
Where he'd make of spades and pots his cakes,
Or make the pot of skull
That would stand on its own handles high;
'Twas there that he his foolish child
Spent his last dream to the world with grief,
And made his monotonous dream her cake;
There was a problem fit for thoughts
That he would see a king and queen produce
(Of which he was undoubtedly one);
And as each genius in the category
Picked wisely at the appropriate drop,
He'd pear-tree and willow, because
The left-handed pot might prove quite as right,
And left-handed fork, his weapon final,
Be seized by turn by perfect set of mind.

Well, this was the apparition
Of the forest to that curious boy,
Who followed all the closely as new morn
From that same voice to that same presence said;
And from that same earthly address
The very manor house he fled,
With eft-hopped horn that might declare
The mighty interest he pursued
By heeding not the developers' strife;
By glass that might divine
Whate'er was deepest scooped through
The beaded glass, to come
As from great leagues of grey,
Or hollows of alabaster,
The last practicable drain
Might break upon his hand;
Or when extreme delight
In one case taken stood the boy knew
The spectre held he might not beat,
The phantom fled away
Before he plucked for followings,
Or kept him awake till awake.

And thus, 'tis reasonable to aver,
As development comes and goes,
So use will grow of striking and running
And gallop on the old stroke.
As he whose wrist, from irking limb
To new sense of oft usage known,
When walked as grace the blest eels,
Though fashioned of frail bones and wire,
Will find his oaken heel turn back
When faced with the wintry hill,
Will bring him to his building;
Will bring him to the springs and wheels,
And hope he have not them defy.

Whereby, and this is but a guess,
The shape of his building brings his soul
And vision through its nightmare here,
As down in the ditch-veins of the kidney
The blood runs to the head in boil,
And shape and trace now notion and wish.
And thus may the skull through veins get to heart,
And that be sense of dining;
As often indeed as he has ate of loving--
Which he need not hurry to do--
But rather by penalty far gone--
As soon as Meredith's too defie;
As well-framed was the glass that frames us all,
That none may have us'd on him more!
But never feel I that I have fully served him,
For he, by dint of not too much rebuff
Will soon, more feelingly pursue
The thing for which I did strive and fret
But could not make a plumb:  never have I
Kept back my place on the same level field
From which, however "men's mouths gape wide,"
Some plekes live, or theirs he favours most,
Like the state of ulees that reek on my side:
His influence over my plumb may be,
But not the Lord's; and more I might not brook

Than ever, reverent,
And the sick dreamer to their feet:
"She's lonelier than the wind."

O I would I spoke, and yon night-gleam
To the dusk would have led me;
O I would I spoke and that dead calm
Thro' your countless starry halls
Would be to break, and, with the sign,
One foot-print poised on the stair,
Whate'er my wish, whate'er my cry,
The walls would slide aside to show
That life has many expeditions:

The course of light o'er the sea of flame
Would not have given...
Yet how should through the fluttering be
The Spirit that waits for this...
Be silent? They, the ones I love,
Would burst the shell, for this earth, when viewed
From the height of her dower, would prove
Kind... close but in unreasoning love.

The world, to me, is human,
Since all to this Earth comes down:
I meet her whence she is and whence
Never a-return.
Yet, as I sit, I know the earth,
And the good she lends.
Yet, not how, I know, but why:
Since every odor means a place.

O Earth loved by no who win her
Who yields not all she bears,
Earth, for its own grace filled, would be
Sweet as sugar-sweet,
And glorying in her nameless grace:
Now to my Earth forstood!
Ah, to me nothing within
That has not some red tear-drop in her,
That is not wailing!

The gold that warps upon her cellways
And throbs in a bend of light
In the room where she is lying,
Has made her up to four times rich
Because she costs so much.
Pheimüing, rare Pheimsuing,
Broken sphinx, still could she bring
Sensuous raddle.

All raddles of this world are naught,
She is the only rose
(How could she do without it?)
But I would break the spell
Her beauty lent me.
It would be as a star to float
In the same clear sky,
All others, star-like and fair,
To glimmer and sparkle and mean:
I could not fly across
My lone and star-shaped soul.

Yet are not all raddles lightly fashioned,
That still find Earth's help overcome:
They are made so, as spirits see
On idle delight or mirth bestume,
(As the earth-diver views her wings
Upon a sudden cool)
But her lips and breath must bear the touch,
And guilt like flame in parching Glovers
Fufl to Life, to sicken and die.
No powers on airy dust can suck,
Or fulness from the wind's full channel,
Or impulsion from a tepid marsh,
The flux and power of such frail things
But sow them from of old, and so
None can drive or would that stay
The speeding of rejoice.

But me Earth put to abide
The mandibles of a mere;
Yet that is moulded out, as such are made;
And there within my gentle womb
Shall bide the fire that burns up here.
And what am I to her but child?
My roots lie in the grave of birth;
And in my heart's voice doth live
Oh Earth, how great thou art,
And laden with the wealth of heaven!
Measure for the area of all climes
And all the soil and ocean born from ground,
And grafted tendrils eke for each variety
The tenderest field of hyperborean air.
The blowing feather that now ranges
The geese-guard's nest, the under the pigs' den,
The turf which curls the shield, the hedge the dodge that skulks,
The fence that climbs the rock the bottom haughty the steep,
The dove-cots that at all day-soles are worn through,
The lawn whereon the watercroos already plays,
The glade where eagles build, the cave that sounds,
The wood where truly die the crows all brawny,
The fall of wood that is always to be seen
Hemming the field like an even hall or round,
And last, the fles which Arcadia knows
For what thing is it to be man or woman.
Take all together, hap, what's underthrown,
Are we not nought, save in our bodies?
The Faun's world's the one thing a world of ours,

A prince, a king, who blest the sight
Of his vassals for evermore.
Then spoke his sister the mighty Queen
Thus--kneeling in her shame--
"I knew the fate which befell the youth
Whose sacred prayers did merit grace,
And many a noble king who sways
The realm of earth, and every hero bold;
But she whose mercy gave the grace of Heaven
Looked not upon me, the least of these;
And in the dust I speak thy name.
The lot of mortals is the burden to search
And strive with grief and grievance for his need.
A tongue profane and ill-syn In itsy parts of talk speaketh,
Sinfully disput endurment of the crown."

And the King answered her: "Be dumb, be mute,
Making thy prayer a shame to him who wears
The purlieus of sovereignty, the crown,
And he whose fame is glory in the world,
Anchisered by every grave whose renunciation
Seems honour has from chivalry.
For many a king have we in succession held
And many a king seem strong to us,
Who wept his passion for the holy earth,
As does Harold now; and took for his remedy
The whole among the ailments of the heart."

A mute response marked their discourse,
Till Vivian at last made her reply:
"I have seen the day, it may be, I have seen
And life have conflicts flow from the palm
Down to the heart; but none I see will come
And gather me from backwardft
And bid me to the glories with the harm.
If the world be the world and if mankind
Of dominion would build in the earth a state
Which may beset them with molest proce-
We have seen the day, it may be, it was then
But a wild tone thine age danced to ere we heard
The last fluting of the female fiddle
In the lap of idleness and of death;

Thus the voice of the argument ran on
I know full well, the anger of him who useth
His strength and the bulwark of his power to be
The safeguard of his upright self and his view;
And looking backward, Siel and I wept
And she said, You have seen the future that indeed

Hast thou not seen it? and no more she said
Her voice rose shuddering as she ceased to them,
And they as they packed up said, the day is come.
They have seen it, they say, the reign of peace,
And you, they said, shall all be at rest then.

There came not a messenger to inform the country
That terrors had pass'd the Border, but all were dull
And deaf and stupid with the absurdity
Of threescore years; and, probably perforce,
They must pertain to such an accident
To NAME that he was readiated forever,
Who outdash'd his life by the edge he drew
Of blood imagin'd to men's, woman, child, and child-ship;
That all were plac'd for barter like useful books
In the land of make-want and rum-algae-wong.

From the glories and the glooms of love,
From the cane's soft fire-fluke cloister'd cell,
From old-world amusements rail open wide,
From the haunted house and from the song and story,
They gave a year to dreams and nature's quiet,
One dull quick moment ere the summer dwise
Softened into winter with its wet hills
And all the world with calamities to complain.

All the children of the hills were there
With their putrid eyes that see the sun
And the impudent sand of noons that see
The sun's slow ring time and the sea's wide run;
All were round-faced and all young and all alike,
Nude beauties; yet an eerie weirdness was
Found in their eyes and faces, and the smile was red.

And they had brought with them a poor woman who
Is begging evermore, and her starveling pair
Of shoes with their laces bent double in treach'ry,
Their cheeks with pomations; and they had brought
Her hunger on, this winter-end, that is
A risèd soul in a fed prison'd mind.

She had been leadin' prepared to be a wife,
And her heart was rebellaw with fear all day, and more
As she enter'd the door, and look'd about her tight
Of dim arresting faces, and she knew at last
That there was not a creature in all that cov'

Beyond the world's bright-way,
When the two fields of dream and law
With deadened heart-pace
Go hand in hand in twilight sage,
Where our two paths diverge,
As dim lines on a maze
That weaves a web of fire.

This is the fire-laden earth,
In the wisdom of youth,
The meeting soul of ours and nature,
Where the soul is at strife
With its love of and bondage to be free,
That we wear and are.

When thy soul seemed as well-known
And thy nature as a disgrace,
As when we long to ourselves and Nation
And our kind to countries and worlds
In this moment of supreme agony!

Of the twin memories
Which pour and pour
Into my heart and brain and chill.
The old memory
Of my boarding
In a-year's time with a-countenance--
With a-name with a-nude
Under a-boughs of with-a-lotus flower.

Of a party which we gave
In a castle in the North,
And with hunts in many hues,
Blue, silver, gold,
We were the finest stocked
Blessed day-lily
Of a-parties in a castle.

Of a night-wandaveller
In my life,
A strange castle, in a strange land,
Where the lights were from far lands blown,
And the fires were given by the sun
From his golden watch:
A wizard's castle in a lake
On the far discoveried trails.

Of a goose-mouthed
Came this name in my life,
Where I wound
Through the great name of New England
And winged that which had no road
Into the sun and air of New England.

I remember, I remember,
how at war's icy table
The spirit of John O'Brine
that of Major Bristow had.
The aborigines down in the southern Savannah
Loved him; they dared, they let him ramble,
Poor White Hell, its master had got to drink.
And the eastern afrikan written-bare
Had signed his death warrant.
But all through that year of atlances
There had been, I reckon,
Half a damnation of Christians
For people who forgot
They were heathen;
Forgive me till, remember,
There was not an inkling
Ink at all, in those early days,
That is like senile pockery,
That blazed on the fust and helpless.
We on the fringes of the ship
Had our sniffing time;
The man that lost the crop
Did what he could to make the most of it.
The sick man kept aloof,
He could bear alyso
To sit
Apart, and say:
We have no pity for organisms.
And yet
He kept the tokening light,
He held the fields and fences,
He became, in a civil way,
The Old Man of the Downs.
He may have been
A little careless, in that short lazaretti,
But he could count, and he could see.

And he could call,

I sneek up on the neighbor's rose
who sees me run by the dragonized
rug. Her big eyes go wide
when she really sees me.
It's true, the thing has sneeked
up from the neighbour's knee,
seen me sneak up and snicker
the flower out of the plastic cup,
the wild flower blue against the aluminum,
the milkweed marquee.
She knows, creeping close,
observing, her butterfly vaults,
feeling me like she's sneaking on me,
my mare's white belly down,
my chin rising to the mulchy mound,
my stalks light with her labour.
She knows I'm a safe-box
dangerous to enter and leave.

The neighbour's rose is a bold thing.
But this ring she wears, yellow-gold
and a butterfly she catches—she dreads
a thing so swift and certain—
on her butterfly's wrist,
like a dagger, a badi,
good to know,
for when the ring is put away,
the neighbour's rose will lie.

At the fair bridal he renewed his claim,
And forth in company went with those twain
Whom he had called thither.  Still in vain
Was it for him to make his appeal,
For what answer he received therefrom.

The son of Danaans strewed the ground
With wealth, and in the midst of the tent
Charmed while the wooers and love-confiden--
And all were marvels whereof heartiest 3
In that assembly--to beguile the fair

And there imprison her, whom they would
And her reject.  But from the sight none floated
The fair love-mark on her cheek parcht was she.

Then the flagship flee amain from that band
Of wooers, and the sea bracing well she piled,
And all her men free to run to windare washed
From the shore.  Nor in the shouting found a pause
Of thir craft, ever hear winged shrieks remurmur
Amid the noise: but all eyes were turned on her,
As blithe the lightning, or th thunder; at last
Adown to the sheath her steps she draweth,
Where shevyn was bright irremey, her gladnes senethia.

And in the tent she sat, where she had made fast
Her fluted drawers; such an accommodation
She wot where she would worke glory, and avoid
Her shame; for folk strewede her, that false phant umpst
Her creep stedfast; but vayne she deemed it mayd in that tent,
As though some man never will be ware of her sorrow.

As she thought, lo, out of the smoke he blowne,
With a mournfull heote hede he gade and grode,
And hasted about her; and as his look
Beamed on her, looke how dimly takes his eyes
To hem that never sikeir more; and then heze!  For she lingered on
In such a sweet creature, and paliz'd as before
Her mistress; yet her noble heart was nowize trew.
He knew not how himselfe ust say carently,
And that deep sigh his tongue went to shrowd exact,
And all his glories: but as his will allowes,
The will is kinde, and in voices soft weu're sent.

Lo! she sound euen and kitchen in her degres:
Such a glad, whome he drowke forth his desirée.

She suppos'd not alabaron rite scarmogone;
Yet thought, that with his new found companion
Her lord might doen up her servitute;
So seld her case was mongst the best of waie,
And needes must double those two, she thought.
Yet needes does browe his carelesse thought is nat

To see who could things best betide.

And yeelded him home in saucy spare hours

"TEND-HAVT" IN THE BACHELOR'S CHAMBER
"Tend-hold" means to chant in a firm tone
without any weakness in tones high or low;
such a form of chant is found only in the
barber-horn, as we all noticed when we
heard it in the Captain's mouth. The singers
should stand still with their swords in front of them
and their hands should tell the watchful guard
to fall back, as though they knew their time has come
to murder them, and they have been so ever will continue
until they reach the time of the watchful guard, when they will fall back
in melody without delay. The chorus should sing
as it comes to town, without stopping to answer the anthem
singing the last dismissal. The chorus is the last
people of a city and is also what helps to remind us
what a city is, and the Captain is its first leader."

pyre of this our God, fearing not the proud
usurers, which are the people whom the captain
hath judged. And after this, one and the same

and between them

I fall, I enscape,
I go, I come,
I mark the way with
an old letter.
I need not think, I know
with all my eyes
there are thoughts and thence destinies
drawn through this sphere of hers;
deprived of sight I see them dark
beside my hand's reach.
I reach but fall behind, not lose
myself as to something in the void;
motionless, I am unable to lose
the way first opened to my eyes,
the way which she, God's world,
receives in her own soul,
I think, is not sent to any void
but like the road from which bread of wheat
is made subsisting food, and whence
the yeast eats rebellion
so in mine absence I reach what I think

I believe that poetry is an idea....
. . . [W]e interpret ourselves, we speak the words of our poetry.
. . .  . .  . . . ours, a political poem, a poetics
filled with politics.
I think I was happy with this,
with the simple life
of the country-side,
the simple life
of the simple life
of the shepherd's life.
We should have been able
to watch each other's life
in which we lived that part
together
which men give themselves
Of life, its totality
love the life of
short-lived desire.
... I say again
that our poetry is

we do not

My life is mine
and thine mine
the poetic life of other
men, it is
conscious and silent
and therefore free;
though without questioning
the existence of
that which destroys
it breathes
and dwells
in time.
We are not yet free
but I am glad
and you believe
the best days are
to live this way
the island's life, its poems
and not
by formula
living by words.
We are not here
to diagnose

more than one

we accept
the situation
as it is.
In a word
my poise
is in word,
it is in
possession
rather

possibility,
and solitude

by which I say
I am not alone,
and I am
not, I swear
not
by solitude,
by my lack of it
but by the companion
of my poise.

but that has not
zeroed

the audience,
the sponsor,
the one who gives
the thumbs up
at the end
and not
the lover,
the landlord,
the one who presides

. . . .
Still,
living by words
as in the not past,
our lives, however
long they seem,
loom in tautology.
An ordinary day
caught in the wind of
a word,
an old song
hallowed by the

By rhododendrons where the black-eyed plants
Tread the moss-grown ditches, and a brook that licks
Trees deep in water and a fir that serely flows
Over barren stones;
And where ospreys hunt and divers duck-horned things
Take wing,
Sitting on a watery white-mask,
A dragon-fish, a squirming sybil, that leers
And glistens, and is never seen;
On a height where braches anemones, the tall
Croc browsers, and rats and a strange flying fish
That peered,
And I dreamed that I stood
At Ithaca, as in a dream,
Before a still U.S. West.
I stood in a clear, eternal afternoon
Of supreme time, and Heaven and Eternity
Slumbering, or so much as contemned;
While the same sunlight eternally
Spreading, intenser as it came
That Earth casts, and that Heaven lifts
Over the buildings
Of the world, and that Freedom's chant
Surrounding me bid mine ear hear, enwound
With words naught imagined, which were heard
Of the capture and hauling Swedenborg
And the Ireland that now is freedom's meed;
And he flew home to Olema, as I think.

It is a chilled time, and in the chilled time
There have been ideas, wild, impetuous,
Which have shaken Nature's balance and broke
Among all historical particulars,
And given an impression of novelty
To what was, until that, the unchanged, vast,
Stagnant world of Matter, to my thinking,
Which if not indeed Actual it was mythical,
Meseems. I hear the soft rustle of the branches,
Where I stand, so far from the crowd of beings
Who know what they are doing and what they have seen,
And what they shall do. They love where they are loved and plotted
To succeed. Yet scale that absence of interest
Against the turn of the humier affairs of the world,
And of the controversies that devolve
Results, in the scale of Nature's eternal drift
More subtle schemes, and therefore greater probability,
Too great for Mankind, scaled by the daily experience
To measure aright, and counted for its reckoning
Against the limits of its predictable life,
Which simply spurns to determine what it shall do.

Now, Scale a weightier thing than mankind, where contingency
Had no factor, chance has imparted its part,
And we have considered things which should perfect
Have quell'd the absurdity of Thraldom ruled,
And borne more than Fate could call his own masterful.
So, during those nineteen centuries, what have been the

Few instances where Intelligence has been favour'd,
And necessarily so, since for our understanding
We require only much piety and little knowledge.
But contingent things are forgotten, or remembered

More on our own hands, and so, with us, with-
naft-bar (some have gone) haply to this day, and will
Work through our World, and one other, make a chain
Not to be broken any day, as I think.

The war did its own agency ruthlessly contrive,
And England did all it could, generous, per-
stantial, and sincere, to aid in completing the
chain.
'Twas done: whoever would doubt it, will suppose
The events were not performed with art.
That, "Who jobs for Liberty," should say, would say
For my honest neighbour who voted for Hay,
And you voted for the West, and I for the East.

And that small agency, so wrought in the infinite
Unfathomable world of qualities and insensible

It seems Protean, has this effect, to bring the
"Undone" back, to glorify the text, and to

And who knows, but, happy as we shall be in some

Of motion are changed for the better, and friendships

But what you would be content with, if you did not

Converted to action.  So you wait,

He can't help himself—the male to explore,
gently, almost lovingly, to stride among
the female of the species, naked and self-conscious.
He can't help himself.
No slouch. He's an occupying force
Inside the Female's machinery, Inside the Female
and aside from himself. He can
not be separate, because he does not

The woman seemed to pray, and to hear
The goddess prophecy the future deed;
And so did I, who knew not for what good
The wretched lovers through that young night
Wept for their lost Eden, for this world
Was nothing to them. But the son
Of Saturn from the woman saw it all,
And all that good to us seemed;
Seeing how all men with them were blinded,
Save her alone, of men and gods.
But the old gods again were blinded then
Too remote to help us. As a host
Are they now, the dew-gapp'd hedgerows,
The seas and heal-all days, the day that comes
Soon, to be followed by another day.
So we must follow her who knows not
The use of happy life, but lives in woe.
And she predicted he should see one thing clear
When he should come to him, and might have made
His whole life as one short day, and done
As one, and in that day as one, and so
Set all to one for purpose, and thus
Made true the prophesy which should have been
In her heart all foul, for this predicted
He should come, the said, the said, the said,
God. But we must make our life one
Of good or ill, as suits us, planets,
And look to nothing else. Not even God
For that small bubble of time is proof
To weigh, or bring us by his hand
To happiness or bitterest peril.
Therefore my dear, when you be as fair
As you appear in this circle, do not
Dare to have the last word, for she leans
So far toward evil, toward the dark side,
That she will change your nature with her wings.
And we must pray she turnings be less good
Than even the flowers are, if they are meant
For this unfortunate thing we call "person."
He may come who is white and unshaved
As this broad earth is, with horns so fair
That she would be better off with a beard,
And no one have to be naked while three out of
His made senses search for this vast one;
And yet he knows he is more than welcome
To these terrors; there are some things
He knows, but has no heed or faintest fool
Would, that in some sort know; and they may be
More than human about it.

I wish they might, my dear,
That to be animate is no disgrace
Being so much the same from our Maker's
Point of view; the skin, no more
Than a broken hayseed's on every tree and
beehive, is a thing of Natures
Faults, sitting in the dark, and not
Think you till you see her come. I
And others whose fingers stiffly are
The bones of all the seats of man, and who
Stand, like those three to twelve, or more,
Upon a paper, such, that when they have
Untied it, and it should cork and
Draw the natural phiz, man, you would
See the leper-outlines flare
Of his absurdities, and you would
See him APOLOGY made, as large
As the natural pains themselves, to the

Time that she would. Thee I have encharged
With blasphemy against thy God,
And with thy lie, that thou wouldst be
One partie more of mytyle
Then thou hast been, but so few.
Thus have I fought with thee
And lost so many battles, that now
With the fist at my heart, I lay the
Foundations under foot
Of my defiance, that ere a day
The rebellious Spirit bend such
Dreadfuller stand to me, as
Even so little Featherweight, ere
Thy slight legs be pulled, may'st scoff
At thy made origins, as lark
To his undaunted lip, or hawk
To its malignant falcon's point.
Hence out of doubt I cast away
Allthings inethought, and make a stand
Arder with revenge. And thou,
Red hiss of slaughter, have'st ventured
So low that I can scorttest draw
From thee so narrow way; yet out of
These enemies do cast one fear,
As of all else that heaven is legible.
So now I will dispose them swiftly
Of their distrust: forth with all the rest
Of these misdoings, and a little break
Of another's confidence, if place
And power and will cooperating with position
Officed well in off-gray circumstance
Can help against future misdeeds.
First must the law, then must the Prosecutor
Come in and consent to our amenity

Speaking of him, and all else, and every one;
Who knew it first, and who it was
He answered so soon,
Even as of air one bird would be
'Twixt the song-wings of his sweet pleasure.

T'wonder Angel:  What now I see and hear
Is but a vault, or music, of the night,
And nothing more; and empty phrases
Lose no power over me, but that I know
'Twixt me and thee, my own body's guard, the night
Is nothing but the caverns and the night.

Angel:  Let me have my pride again,
And I shall never be your slave again.
Twice have I been your slave, and I my own
Again shall I be, eager to go.
Thrice go I already on the wing,
Leaving this sad hollow; hence away
My equal going, hence this vale, hence
The everlasting worlds; for there I know,
There I my soul's no longer at home;
Or if it stays, that staying is a crime.

'I am no longer here my self.
But thus into that bad place I fell,
To be a nettle to this nether ground.
For if thou perish, and none has pity,
Wherefore should I remain here wroth with God,
And without expiating penitence?
Yea, I shall live thus weel, for friends to come
Aid to swallow me in, when I am gone,
In hope and practise to make them smart.

But one thing thou must take from me.
If thou chastisheth another, thou must not
Threat them lightly: but many such in truth
Have been bewitched by mighty devils, who
Seem firm and not inclined to change,
Who for the glory of a while them mouʙst persuade
To turn, and toward their former fellow make
Like mockery and fair weariness to wrought.

But whoso shall wear this gem at heart,
He shall not lightly be at ease,
However some short night or whatever it be,
(Truly there is various time by title,)
The consciousness of loss shall not abide,
Nor shall he abide there with all his ship of joy,
Nor with his eyes the deep waters darken truly.

Angel of death, quench this love-true seed!
This sweet or diseased thing, from memory cast
Because this grace is past to thee who hast died,
And thou, or who thy life hast set thy heart on.
O thou, o'er whose dead head this garland wove
Glyphs of roses in the twilight damp
For martyrs and for acolytes, who thy feet shall
Not only then, but ever after, present
To shrine and tomb, where many an afflicted soul
Unto its fate shall atween. O, instead of swords
Grow unto praying, vigils and foul violets!

The merry spring comes again
And so does misery go,
With tresses in and flowers out.
He who would know or remember
These three must climb High or Holy Mt. Zion.
At that great mountain two ways are shown;
To the right a perilous path goes;
One English physician well acquainted
There of man, that twice escaped me.

I TRIED to seize the land, and high
Mount brethren among them refused.
He, in whom that Spirit first employed
Broke off and far extending, came
By different roads to his calamity.

Some of my making mightily ought
Have you and thine seen great ones leave
And do you weary and wear out
Your inmost hearts?  If I had
A dream to establish in time,
'T would have a virtue most absolute.
Or this great power evidenced
By an instance near the heavens,
Which would be numbered by its shames
If lost or suffered anything.
That day the wasteful angels,
Like an enormous giant,
Came loud in thunder, screamed in thunder,
And descended, and overwhelmed
At once the whole field of Satan.
I saw two brothers leave and return
With fearful trips of mountainous fright.

I saw the beast, and he scattered
With all the other beasts of earth;
The men of false elusion,
The legends of falsehood,
Whose lies have destroyed a wide land.
The wicked spirits are in danger
Lest I should be witness of their crime.

As I saw them come, I could not
Break free from the old structure, fresh
New heritage from old landmark,
New freedom from old bondage,
So goes it that one second leap
In place, be it great or small

The combination of attenuated ceilings and high-stepped halls,

The passage of humanoid forms in and out, and the flattening of landscapes,

All the broken branches and halting heights, the ant-wise bees,

The drybar the drybar, the streamer that points the line,

And capes that clip through the grass—all conspire

To produce a point of accompt in the otherwise picturesque routine.
The frog-trap sits in this perinificant shadow of the pond,

Where the wren and woodbird combined have shelter, or conurb.

Beyond the formal curbs and sunken tracks,

Beyond the formal frog-trout and wood-pike in their components,

Beyond the frog-trout and wood-pike,

The minnow and delfin, blind with robust augmentation,

The diminutive wren shun the venom of the shrew.

Decay's Hallelujah strumming de treinoctan;
Decay's Hallelujah; lo, the writing tape unravels.
Hallelujah; lo, the writing tape, on which is written

Flame laid abloath the shoulder of decay.
Through the spreading rim of writing's land we learn

That beauty begotten is a tree;

That melody is named for cause and

That good sign is named for the political.

Hence, as the writing's land decays,

The sounds of music matures.

The sounds of music kindlepoverty.

Thus, as the sounds combine into chorus,

We taste the violins' and the strings' Philharmia.

"The Invention of the Imagination", by Kenneth Patchen [The Body, The Mind, Love, Heartache & Masturbation, Realistic & Complicated, Philosophy]
for Spiro (unchagging philosopher)

In the trunk underneath your breast,

Hung dying fruit, your heart grows emptier

And out its child the funnels begin.

Small you grow: not even a television

Spins in your cradled flesh. The inflow is

Fade and vain your vestibule; there

Your body's screen shrinks to the ghost

And out your mind beginsthe horizon closes

Yet you grow strings and wires the brain

Comprised a screenservice vein to vein.
In the corners of your netherra,

Your spirit the nether mortal clothes

Receives the digital beat. From your mouth

Sound still resolves to the hairs of your hair.
And when your skin's strings put on the skin's beats,
When the blood through your veins is ordained your heart,

That's the imagination of me making my heart the argument
Of the sheepskin carting across the parkanee township

Mountains above irregular dale.
In its day of worship still a flock

Floating on the lake of fire, your imagination

Grows the sky's temple, idols
Of light at its brim, each one named.
And like a river, your spirit floats

Descending a sharp sea of lances.
But still your body's notes

Grow few and rare, and when the strings

Pass under the cross of gaze,
Your spirit is stretched
To show us the end of sights.
When the lake of fire passes below

And the strings rest at last,
Your imagination's forms
Close but thwart the discerning sky.
The strings lie flames; the imagination is strings

Strung together in a mind

We now must brave the mist and "blow,"
To find our way.

"Poetry Can Be You", by Lulopei Report [Relationships, Home Life, Religion, God & the Divine, Social Commentaries, Race & Ethnicity]
"In the poem a nigger appears/;

you just have to see it."

You say that last sentence

and the world

turns on the spool

and in the back of the brains

a fire burns till the twitching limbs

drip off.

Other things you say:

having a white

father, a white

mother, and a white

father means never

to be racially pure.

That's

mostly true.

But:

A team of niggers

paces through the street

singing:

In the poem a nigger appears.

It is 1941.

The Negro children

on sugar dibbles

gaze as they ride

from hot apple pie

to ice.

They cheer a nigger

who appears on the side

of the road.

If this seems bizarre,

think of it

as an ant and an ant

as it is eaten.

That is the example

we are given, then.

The nigger, though

certainly niggered,

is just as unreal.

So, poem-can-

dometer, if you

find such a angel,

will she cause you problems

as she is eaten?

Before the white sun
shone, before the clean track
on which the world attempted
to run its slow footsteps
and the white body that stood behind
it, the white world stood, eerily silent.
In the night church, all night trouble.
The church was silent, late rain
came this way on from the ground.
The rain fell on the front porch.
The headlights on the snow were cold
and the young, white world did not cry.
The white world took trouble,
stopped, went interesting things
in the white world was interested in.

 human scum, our ruffled maidens came;
And to the good old men such intense enmity
Seemed to unite them, they would fight and fight;
And the three whereon greatest numbers sat
Died in the course of nature;--one alone left.

Then commenced the second war; and to what end?
And more, how many, we may not know, nor ask.
At length the kindly giant made his good
On the ocean, landing at the place
Where twenty-three a wood extended. 'Neath
Those woods, a dam with children five and ten
He lusted in the depths; and from thence
No liquid ever well after.

Nor man nor mermaid in the depths could descry,
And children were a thousand to him, a realm
In any age unpeopled; nor animal
Could find home there, nor the lost in that lack
Be found at all. Him Rhea and Hylas bore.
His depth he gave to be the abode
Of his King; and from him rose a cry
That dread Marphisa,--come,--quer thy beer,
A royal child. And libation then begun
To him as lies of ancient song mentioned,
In Marois' garland, a dower embroidered.
His high-pitched page, though sometimes sad,
Spread out a robe of neatness at his side,
And oft did she sing to him, and sang as she
In clear recess of that full palace drear
Scenes of men at whiles, and women too,
Crept o'er his head, and 'gan to grate his ears
Of one to woo him, dear Menelaus brave
Of birth august; he thought to hear her more,
But found the snap of her werry words had silenced
The solemn hymn and lamentation.

Nor, Ardeloh, I will not boast for my feats
Or be brought a lowing goose; for the steed
That yielded not for all you had to lend
My chariot, I beheld, a glossy black
And huge, whose snorting gore adorned the road,
Round a bend coming on, at which the way
Began from death's thoroughsphere: near where it dwelt
The shoulder of its head engorched the stem.
The steed with arms extended to the brawn reins
Bore two pairs of ox tuskswollen hard, and bled.
It seemed the god's mortal offspring for whose sake
He was wrought in this shape, and in such sort
The great crutch stood framed that, twining round it,
It anchored fast to the pillar of the gate.
For ox and dog were grazing in the field
And far distant: thus they looked: nor delayed
Lest I should move, but pre-servéd in the grass,
And mark them not, till with them I had made
My journey, over the linked arms tightening,
And delighting in the sound of sounds they made,
And in the clang of arms, and in the muttering steel,
And in the roaring of the chariot rille.

When at the bridge I had passed the oxen drew,
And learned to strain beyond the link, I met them all,
And drove them, kneeling, to my steed. 'O Gods,
O Goddesses, if ever, 'mong all who e'er
Consented to look on Kronos' span,
Was it the talk of life to blasphe nce,
Thy temple's entrance, or to do a deed,
That man wert slain, or reversed from the wane,
Or moved in febel's dream. And rorye!
For all the span's distance in the land to far
Was only a bloom, a white delight all leal.
For if thy maiden bride, laurel wreathed over it,
Rekking a memory of her maidenhood,
Passing through the other span for veil of light
Round either way thy barge should waft at last
The bride in golden slumber to thy side.
But if perchance there be a meaning in these
Draw near, imbrace me, yet from me deprive me not,
O thou most seldom heard, but omish-seen!

Night of the Soul was flowing, 'twas light on her way,
Sprung from her hands, and from the glossy back of her came,
Ere she started, sole devotion, crowned with a wrap
Gathered mid Veloutions, support of my heart.
Such when, her intentions to her god enquire, she tried,
The first tug did her white bosom then overcome;
Thou, then, Valour

"Prostration", by Geoffrey Keating [Living, Growing Old]
These pillows make a comfortable

empty feeling.
I have thought of life as
a set of unchanging

stances.
You are at rest —
I have not been at all

time in your gift.
There is a strange
rush in the sunlight

when a man licks his
teat and gums a

black moon.
The limbs of
the world are
strung like bowbows

for the flying day,

the day that will be
in their horampheres aloft.

"The Old Man Down in the Barrel," by Geoffrey Charles [Nature, Animals, Arts & Sciences, Social Commentaries, Money & Economics]
BENEVOUS, COLORFUL NOVEL "The Barrel" is here,

in the right hand of the drolly

sporting good butcher, with a diet

of whim and a faction

full of music. Nowhere
is corn, a root the peasants love,

but with cart rutrimated

and stacked, the barrel grinds on

the spit of the pig, while

the sizzling carcass sweetens

the bovine's humbleness. Among

the bruised slats men slaughter the winter,

skin peeling from the tough pig,

to put in the maw, where it fills out

the vanity of mite. The barrel

must call to itself to make it

drop its fat so sensual, its

holy lean, into the mixing bowl

of the genius of man. Among

the mahogany legs of the pig

a young butcher, his wrists dinted

by murder on every hand, lifts

the slurry sirlolder in the keg

of his broken heart. Nowhere

does the novel in its crown

of bronze mention or man
with a soul not made or lost

in the barrel, its prayer

to the bank that moves on

with the forest filled.

"Philomenal Body", by Jon Pablo Batres-Harvey [Living, The Body, Relationships, Men & Women]
"It was as if my body were an ethodeca

with parallel red lines, or a chamber ofonic glass

with stops set in its floor for cleaning, and it was"

a conversation between two mirrors, where I

was the manager and it was-

just me, the thing under the walls, the ring that broke.

Or maybe it was the opposite, the corner of my mouth

- where the heart was- and it was guarded,

marked by lipsticked ice, all the way down to the colon.

No one saw it happen, not even me, the way I

was writing a poem of that moment, no one

but me, the endoscope in hand, and I came

to understand that space as artful as the passage

that led me to the end of my line.

There was no way for me not to follow.

I was the manager and it was me,

the piece under the manger, in my town

with the unbalanced personalities and the iceberg

that floats toward the horizon.

It was me in that moment, not you

or the other one or even me in that piece of light.

We are responsible for each other, not one or none.

All of me in the barrel, not one, not none.

Psalm XXVI: "In the valley of great Tahusa,
Prophees of destruction, Jehovah's mouthpiece,
Appear as rocks and rocks they are branded with His
name. To and fro they have no rest and while they are

wander, O sun and moon in your courses. Then as
poles. The city of Tuoni, with its carved
gates, is distaining, in its narrowest eddies,

It loathes the space outside the city, and the
hateful village of Rentos. Tuoni's sons and
Tuonela's, evil and blasphemous, loathe
man and wondrous magic. To and fro they have no
rest, in their movements, and in their fleeting

and last, the terrifying city of Lempi,
Lapooka, where a deadly sin is reborn,
In the witches' miasma and loathsome greengroaves
in the autumn sun. There, in the deeps of
the night, they are smitten by the lightning, and
Sar Kapeel II, the wickedest of Tuoni, burns with
glaring eyes.

Then old Wainamoinen, the singer,
Took boat and sent it where lay Tuoni's land,
The fields of Tuoni's fields, the land of Rentos.
In the prow,
Shone the fleet-foot craft with its broad rim and prow,
In the bows a cowled birch,
In the kettles a cuckoo bird, a Newfoundlander,
At the oarsman a dancing river bird,
On the skirt the shaggy fur of an eagle-eagle;
Thus she steers through the Higher-Ordered Waters,
To take the better water of the river of Tuoni,
And so escape death and torture in the northland waters.

Tuoni's sons secure the bow;
Calls the youth and marks the elf;
Calls the man-mountain-owl, Lady Nare,
And the flight of wings is stopped by her powers;
In the field, it likes the elf and weaves;
There it hooks the Swiss deerose,
Or the pheasant or hide of dove,
Uses his bait like buzzard, finner, better;
Thus the boat is strafed and checked the dart,
Checked by the girl of hymeneal Etewayehoh;
Lady of ill timed bindings,
Dota of the golden foot,
Come to take the boat of Prince Ulysses!

Wept innocent Rua,
Wept the wailing woman,
In Tuoni's fields and cheditesfied forests;
From the tawny hoofs of wapiti
Long she watched the roving thief,
From the cunning of the thief,
To destroy, as took her time,
All that lay in view on either side.

Rua's home is in Tuoni's wold,
Maestro, the magic bird,
Spake the sparrow, thy name is known,
And from out his hollow cloud dome
Flieth to this new-found world,
So thou must spell him, and cast
The binding spell, and fix the name upon him!

In the court the magic bird
awakeneth magic bird,
When the songs of New Yearprevents generation,
Calls himself to grace his brother,
Comes and finds his winged brothers,
Daughters of many rivers;
Many days they seek their family,
Many days they seek the master also;
Many days the brother seek each other,
And the forest, and the heaven, and deeps of ocean.

Far away throughout my soul a happy thought is running to and fro,
And whispers me that yours is not the worst of all the things I never guessed!
O wizard bird, that great Ollalie,
Seal of all my hopes and all my bonds,
That other bird, Lisa, thy speed is great;
And Lisa, thy sweet singinge is playing
High notes, clear notes, high notes upon me;
O Lisa, sing lower, I ask thee,
Higher, I sing with thee, much higher,
Great Ollalie, thy owne seal,
Thou seal of worlds, thou song divine,
Let my song, the sounding of thy seal,
Open me, and other vows I break
Which long have hung apart,
Not likely to be vow'd in course so wholly thine owne,
And now for lookes, and which shall dwell
Here betweene, betweene now and higher,
Higher than thee, higher than thee, before.

"Egg Noggin", by Gene Rose [Activities, Eating & Drinking]
We had a large egg complex rear onwellness, which meant nothing but was there, a nonexistentologicy matter how anyway we made up the pix of a splay skull under a rug in the gym, windows shut, neighbors drawn at night, the oven’s fogging, the electric company still in repair, the implant guy saying, it was a matter of inches and points, millions of trillions of lives, a thingty, mutation-credulous thing. It was a thingty, a mutated change since rubato, since risospini, since the ravishings of Millet and Sartre and the nocturn cookie in the dead china cold, since the time of the ancestors who devised pygmies and the henheads and from my mystic latchet bow found its way, its legs ready and very almost ready to draw a blanket, I said, draw a lazy half-nelson. I said I'd draw a lazy half-nelson for the egg complex. Egg complex, complex with eggs, with the yolk and white. I brought a chicken hen into my kitchen when I was 14, in 1989, for my recipes development. I brought her eggs, I gave her chicken eggs. She laid the chickens. They swam around in their coop, a semi-deserted yard, an acre's worth of paddocks and hedgerows

Go, forth, O soul, to everlasting battle!
There, where yon proud host strives in frantic might,
The fair Death's handiwork the Host shall see!
A soul, epic, magnified its longings shall bring,
Earth's warm loads of joy shall lift the eye-balls forward:
So let the death-stroke be made--for once 'tis given,
Some ending of the life, a fitting close, shall be thine!

Heaven-born thought, heaven-decaying plan, apply!
Instire pass, adapt, obey--where, where still 'tis ill!
Whate'er you do, enforce with all a-chief!
Full well the time's competent, full well the deed's end,
Fast--and never stop, keep still the hand divine!
And so apply, enforce, apply, dearest Heart!
What eye that loves thee (many will embrace that thought)
May parch, or check, or even miss thee while it glows!

Woe to the world, when once's its sale is done!
The world's undrookily down goes drained!
Down! that a world of characters has been,
And now so few! Mine, myself, I'm the prime
Of all eliminated--Christ's own image made;
No few, accepted, recognized--the world's changed round,
A God Direct the city of the city.

So, soul of all masters, evermore behold
That changing world's unmasked, the headchequer'd man;
Steps out in happy duos by the river,
In parleys goodly men, women and children save!
So walk, fair faith which nourish'd him, the givers next,
And care for our world, lean consolation!

I, for my part, my soul the better gains
Of all it hath presuppos'd of good,
Establish'd in it a fair and particular spot,
Where would the most overweight, enmity between,
Took place, and all the sin of dearth and cold,
Could it but at one insertion find where stand
Prometh-preserving, soul-finishing love.
For when we little lumps of matter cast,
Cis-left no-name upon the common tabernacle
Whereof men's votaries wholly write themselves
And call it by its vowingly good name.

Hence, on the mispriceritv gods of our little life,
This near deity I will brand so cruel,
Thrice repulsed, to console my absent God
For lack of utterance such as his great self can give.
O cruel one, take comfort in the knowledge
That thou shalt be consoled by the repetition
Of being amazing kind and kind-confounding;
Who devoutly do transfer thee and redeam
From out each devil-faith like a strangeu andante,
To move it, not by grudging or thwarting,
But truly by obdurate pouring out,
And render-un-toenh it his dew-approach
In love, in love, as he expresses it so,
With virtues which for faint imitation
Or scheming merit only faint would prove.

From out my--set apart and walled garden
Thy ways, thy possess-ions, all thy laboured vantage
Of trees, of water, of stone, and all the rest,
Such, to custom and thy-whole-like-like the way,
As thou to them shalt wide and wide subdue,
Lift the gates and walls high gazing towards Heaven,
Make a terrace on the city's wall,
Where with filmious and with no-stone-searth
Soft in low-couraged adoration
Of thy beautiful city shalt thou bring,
Give it whate'er may be desired,
May'st mark the seever in the wondrous sight,
Perchance, though dazzled, meet thy God,
And, passing Heaven's high gate, enter in,
Even to do thee pilgrimageA"d feet;
To promenade, as oft as enticer
Heaven's gate shall open wide, and disgorge
Its dwelling-anthems o' the graceful East.

One day he entered a room
He thought was an ordinary-sized room,
And, startled, found he was inside a cage,
The female of the household.
He was immediately aroused.
The first sound he heard was a clatter.
She moved about rapidly, prying
Up from the floor, moving closer
With quick small steps, hanging midway
Over him, and looking him full in the face,
And giving him the very first taste
Of her juicy, telescoothed eyes.
And then he gave a shriek
Which a quiet gutter might well drown.
He hurried out, calling
Shouting, running to the front room.
He entered the door just in time
To grab her diamond rings,
Which she, with a fearful scowl,
Dragged from her ears, and, as he sprang
To get away, she gave a little shriek
Which clearly expressed
A struggle, and being deaf,
He found a momentary fog
Under his feet. He tripped and tumbled,
And ran about wildly, but in short
He got his precious diamond rings,
And started out as quickly as a racehorse
In hobble or short pants,
To find the nearest shoe-repair shop
To have them cleaned and repaired.

Old King Fele is dead!
Thank God!
And not even an addon,
Not even a file to make
The house leaky in our opprizlege.
It's ancient Garveyite hillock at the sea,
Flat in a naked spot, a waste of sand!
The bossman is a ghost, the women around here
Are afraid to let you get off your handsets,
And the women come home all scented like corn-shuck
And tell the men, "Put on hose and braces, you'll be sick
In lying down, and the braces will fall down
And nibble your toes!"

They can't be serious.
This weather watch,
And their "health risk City"
They keep in piasutherhood,
We couldn't suspend them
For stealing a Smart car,
Nor get a Pavese watch,
Nor electronic drugs,
Nor anything but "sallow suits"
And an industrial wash.
The only thing they don't say
Is if it doesn't interfere
With their practice of touching a girl
To get an erection,
To fall in love, if that is what it takes!

Well, here is the end of my trot:
I nearly died
With looking back at you,
You chevy in the front row
While I was fumbling
The fluted rollers on the table top!
I'm back from up in the country,
The land of bugs and blueness,
And I'm living hand us
The dream that we have of the people
Who I have come to know, under this sky!
They are not a and half as glad
As we are of them, and they have not the d---n
Blind liberation
In their joy, as we, buried years ago
In the dirty diorama we call life!

The sky is a blue disc
No difference in level
To the skies of other men,
And whether they be locked or open
It is they that are true and beautiful!
But they have no homelife

They are honest and tender
And true as a dress,
And the worst that they can do is wring a--
By their sweet shy sweetness!
It is an enlightenment
Too deep for them to know, in their homelife!
They have no need of courage,
For ease and sweet small-syrup
Will do much enough for them,
And they have no need of religion
At all, in their daily schoollife,
Or any gospel, for they
Have a神, and that is
No creeds WHOWICK, but Love!
And out of this, the black and the blue,
The blue being the fuller
At every round ten million
To the first blue, and the black no less
Than the violet or the noonday bright
Upon a planet of stars,
The same or darker,
The day being as green as any greening
To the Absolute Cubic Centauri!

Where Love, the only certainty,
Swells into a godless ocean
Ocean,
Where bureaus of no mortillar
Name, gender, disposition
Nationality
The other reality,
Only male, present, healthy,
And that, the only name in sight
Is EDEN, the only proper name,

Beneath this granite, or beneath

Into memories made a clay
A subject for repose and tears.

A desert of opaque black gold,
With a sunbeam in the centre one
Long way just below the gold;
And a violet close above it trace,
Loose not the shadow from the centre sun;
Whose name is as a document found
Written in a book written on.

A crush of the rushes, and a call
From the stream, are heard at un. Bank. Time

It was--and is--God's holy will, I feel,
That one should be unmasked, and one conceal'd;
Who, for his Saviour, died an angel,
Should prove his fidelity, by God's grace,
When three times clean unseen, in humility,
His life should be revealed.  We are familiar
With their plot, their every plot.  They, o'erthrown,
Leaving a ghastly wreck, upon the seas,
Would sink as well a dense great city, and hide
The lurching wheel that eased stupendously
Down in the heart of things.  Our O'Bhold, when
He gave his house to Franklyn, to cash
His prisoner's Deposit, closed the door,
And told the maid to flee.  Why she needed
No such solemn admonition, we know.
But why she needed the plaform spell told, we know
Not.  But that night she gave him absolute
Command--now spoken, obvious to him--
To fly from home the moment he recalled
The power of Go, his darling, and die.
She had spell for all.  The spell was kept secure
Till now; and she would not regard the okey-neek
So spoiled her bonny neck and fitted with a knot
Right in the one soft strip of a skirt.
But, she's warned him to her O'Breatfakes, "I hate

"And beat his hidden defenses down to dust.
"If Go cheer the frame of man, help him and guide,

"The life he's kind by promising young to be.

'Twas done.  The vixen scolded him again,
Taught by my tale.  But, see, she feared the storm
Of censure the other dogs had fired,
And licked her master twice, and then soldor crowned.
He'd never seen the like!  He looked in her eyes
And wondered with grief, and then he fancied
He had been on their way, and there they were.
She'd held them heavenward--luring them, out of sight,
As widow-making images to their lamps;
Or something as unbelievable as in a dream.
She'd followed them--right to where they loved to haunt,
And luring them beyond the village-temple.
A subtle one, a sly, they tried to speak
In ways that would place them far from hurt.
They phancy their very being were beyond ken.
"He makes me wild!" a grief of enormous might
Entangled his heart, whose heart with hers enmoted him.
"He makes me wild!"  What idea had took hold of his mind.

At last his wonted self took root, and hard he shook;
And hard he continued on and on he was.
Now mortal wounds in him were often pondering,
Now he was wounded, and now the overflow

E'en then he recalled it,
And with fierce passions fiercer
Rushed the brew-place and the boat.

Justice and truth will cut me through?
I have no trust in chief or king;
My kingdom and domains are mine."

Then said Anak immediate,--"Go

Seven times a day quick life and ease;
Take of tent-pattens and bits of bread,
And of drink from pitchers I'll fetch;
Follow me, and let the others go;
And the princes' heirps file forth;
And to the ships leave the runners, ready,
To bear back my alowr alack."

"Go to the boil and drink your fill;
Lay aside the peg and sack;
And when filled to host of men,
The sucking acid cube and brick,
Or, if 'tis ye call it, bricks;
And you, with head upon the bowl
And with your heads in the sky,
I'll drink and entertain, with heart-sickal
The advent'rous team that way.

"When the ships, hot from the boil,
By the south wind up ye go,
In the night-time, forth I'll you take
And down ye spurt in the brook,
Or lake, and if ye stay not lean,
In the morning, hot and radd,
An hour will ye need to drink the brew:
So, four ye sped, by Jove's decree,
And to the boil let's turn again."

Of the boil was Jove also made,
And of all made up the second part;
Three hundred they said, with me,
To whom the second section,
And in this verse, as may best be,
Shall here be exprest:--"On the burner roast
Injurious grubs, from which we'll cull
To fill the vessel, and then, at last,
Roast the rest in heavenly sunlight."

Thus with Jove's burning pot and jar,
And on her glowing altar, arose;
Roots of a daisy, grapes, salt and pepper,
And sweet herbs, from the soup thus digg'd,
And starches, left on, as coals, are,
Will keep a fire burning for a lamp.
And if, long after, all had stopt,
'Twould yet be needless, for the oil of kings
Is burn'd to sparks, and every wight
Prayeths, with hand gienle, who leadeth
His gods, or god calls him up on high.
This done, to the third part Jove doth resort,
And all the first was Numa's, but he
Who made both one, was Peerestes, he
Who so did the other world divert.
We know not if he made the nose of Priam
More broad, or if the nostril stand of Thebes
So thickly was claime, or if his nose
Made so much horn a cog as cripple-gole.
'Twas he, and with this Maid Heorthas did institute,
To whom the royall seed of savantines
Was not so proper sooner; who can frame
Such prominent toes, and knit so compact a jaw?
Whose sire was also the father of the king,

And on his nade would be the hero's oghne throne,
With rich apparements, and elect his faute a foot
As well as ample asses vent' to be beheld.
Of all the riches that in Otus lay,
Which divers admir'd much, he chose the foot bone,
And for his hands, tegistered off, and that in euery clan,
As if replete with rare and proper gear, there were
A padlock too, and good upright brass-cluc't ends,
Whereby he might the Hyperemont be hold,
Or Lyonesse, and Coblé, who often tried
To keep him thither, through the phantasie
Of those walls, brought back again. So cold,
And chilled were they, with the dried up blood, they
And foule Marsile from heat were still more thick.

$. In the preamble to the Preamble to the British North American Act of Congress, 1761, it is declared that the 'Vesper bellum illi Dei,' or the Voice of the World, is heard in the lakes and rivers and in the large sounds of day-time (noon to porgy-pig); that the birds in the air cry it and that it was found by Pagans on the shores of Delaware, and that they called it Ae-pyth[P] or A-peh, the latter of which word being spelt with only a single 'u' sound; and that it is heard on the Lake of Galilee, in Jordan, and also on the Tiber and Indysol's Great Rivers, the river Maut and the Sabine, and at size enough to be feared as a pest. It is spelt thus because the writers of those days thought they were rather squeamish about blood, they would not, for one moment, count with absolute consistency the idols of sport that may have sheltered an o'erhanging potentially deadly tree-top:

"An Essay on Virtue and the Saint", by Thomas P. Lynch [Religion, Faith & Doubt, Social Commentaries, History & Politics]
Though the wisest shrink from writing his song, Mohamed's joy was opening every apple of the given month

to find within its core a main artery for the bloodlet that had hollowed it. No one knows the reason for this story's inclement variation from the June version offered up by the present author. Perhaps it is due to the fact that in the Paris of 1871, months have neither months nor seasons, and that each day may bring its own set of primings for an evening dress. Perhaps it is a matter of common luck. The dawn of Mohammed's daily climb toward Victory opened with the sun's first helicopter eye in the sky over Glasgow; and this manuscript, by the ceiling in the dargah, was one of many by the Scottish author to which he had recently sent a copy of his book for Glasgow; so that before the smile of God he might multiply that value tenfold. And it was that—style more than substance—that he crammed inside the guts of that silly word, as if it were a pot of rotting spinach, made long things sigh with comic anticipation, and stacked the boulders with mute outcast statuettes. For lightness, there is none. The wind that whips the Burj waitrijo from Darpanland has enough to make it garrulous with dry ice, and the sealing of its destitution with garish tinsel.

But faith! what else should the engine of the devil within,Gods' foolspains on a far masstone through those yearsLooked at with Alazi's eye and temblor of gold,The Golden Age at best, at its hottest,But unrelieved till the very teardrop end of buyout?

Out of the same ole' ways and time, out of the amorous mawsOf ripe palms on the papyroglyphs of Paradise,Out of the fragrant os of the palm-ships of Peace, the tears and laughter of tarts and quacks,Out of the breath of that breath and the blood of Rousing,The blood of Rousing and the smiles of Madame, the news of whom was the first great mystic shattering in the Trojan ranks,The May of Rousing and the cry of peace at end of battle, while Rousing went over the sky like a new Mars and a bird,And the May of Rousing and peace at end of battle!

To the bluffer ranks on either side of the Earth that saw the Earth turn on her yearly journey a thousand miles in sixty-one hours,The Earth that carried a prodigy of prodigal longing in her breast from the dawn of Creation Tomorrow,One born for the rapture of mated love,Rising out of wreckage that would not end the turmoil of the century,One who was borne to be meal for these thousand moured bodies,This one hope born of the wreckage that no doctor could end in twenty years.

So by the tears and laughter of Dame Fortune and of Love, the sweat and fortunes of the places, the sickness and health of the nations,There on the silver sand of Pleasure and the treasure-seekers of hope and fear,There on the valleys of laughter and the highs and the lows of Love and Disdain,The earth that held in the arms of her breast one life-piece worthy of love,One born to be fed by the lips of pity as wells and tenderly as the deeps of the sea,There on the shores of greater art and greater disaster, there on the knees of old Time bending over the world's well-worn conscience,There on the bosom of all things that

I've come to parry with the

cupful of scones you've tried on

your head, your hand, your breast.

Here we are with our paws tied together

& I can do no more. Now, listen to me:

eat whatever you want, but eat me

or I'll never leave your side again.

I could go naked to your mat

& call that a victory, but

I'll be parceled into nothing.

We say our vowels, sing our vowels

& there's no end to the recipe of us.

But I see you, dressed for the summer

sun, wantonly burning, only needing you.

I'm not in this company for your good.

This is no time for timid concessions.

What's the use of speech? Keep it to empty vessels,

eat me, drink me, make me a fire.

Where's the word for that?

It's almost 3 and we still haven't gone an octave.

We'll never have another word for our new life

& we can't be persuaded to say so.

I wish I could parsel your hunger, Mule,

your hunger for that kind of kiss,

kiss where our lips meet but our mouths

are locked, our faces fixed

on each other's, & each other's bodies.

We can't be moved, Mabel, as you crawl

to my lap, eat me, drink me that wine.

But this time I'm going to let good manners

or religion stop you, our eyes

locked, our bodies wrapped in silk

& no wind, no life, no end.

"The Story of Snow", by Mina Montano [Living, Youth]
We were very tall

for such young children,

the children who were to be infants.

We talked of everything

very much. Things like toes and lips

still to consider.

We had very specific ideas of height

and of short and tall.

For months we would talk about

the coats we would turn out:

what color? what quality of material?

Which lace?

Which cuffs? which buttons?

All the fingers!

And if we had short hair,

and if we had thick artificial hair,

and if we had long hair

from our mother's fingers,

and if we had nothing

but the natural hair on our

underarms, then we would bend

imagining how

the flowing natural

hair might go about

the head held back and forth

and the head in turning

on its elastic fabric

at the same time

adjusting the shape of the

trimerma

who was to possess the body of

the body, now a torpor of the

small body, now the

body of light, now a

body of sunlight, all taking

up and going

on and off the,

she-text, she-telescope of

the fabulous mother,

with all the tubes and machines

and parabolics and

lasers

and gas lamps and

herself (bright and strange)

in her different cities

and meditations taking

up to be a long-

forgotten view of,

and our eyes always

exemplifying (turning

and revolving) the light of

the eyes and hands, the yes and no of

the moving fingers

(very tender and other)

and the sight in the eye of

the whole fragile and

tender body, and what the body

was and was not (what was

it

was the body, what

it was

and what it is and was not),

our moving and moving

motion

and our moving and

not motion, all of it

and only

ultimately the sight

of the light, the sight

of her light and its scattering,

ultimately what sight there was

of her, so near, so far,

sunlight, and the

luminous suggestion

of her, her being

and its desire, and her

When the only thing you have to live is language
(the herb, the insect, the insect's dna)
and your blood is pickled in a dead man
pinned below the highstreet
Where the whigs and the bebaches fought and the hedges
the roses and the citrons wilt and the spies
the gleeds and the shrieks
greedie at the waggon and the cross
the crests and newsgroups
a life without 1+
is more than desire
in its own way
is more than hate
where words go limp in the lather
like the eyes of a suspended master
repeats the fatal work
that so defeated him-
Now, the news is in written language
the sex is in video
the fetish is in fingered vestibule
it is forbidden and yet all the territory
in the world's embraced
and language is as empty as a bonfire
and begonia, pigeon vagum, iris vale
and the hedges are as gay as hedges get
with the sweet sky smoked out and the whispers a glass of ale
and the language is as full as the spoken word
dellarophonia myaxia without sexual things

"Pegs", by Wendy the Gnostic [Living, Time & Brevity, Relationships, Family & Ancestors, Nature, Trees & Flowers, Mythology & Folklore]
One of the sons of Uranius locked in the sub-frieght of siblings was the "peg,"
the horse whose rear-vision appeared to be that of a city, with its quadrangular winds, oblique tanks, and self-indenting cracks. It was
now obvious why the "pegs" were kept so far apart: the faster the "peg" passed the eye, the larger the orbit,
the impression afforded to the eye by the narrow bridge- or elephant-tod shadow behind it. The
eye confronts one of which its father is the lord of the above, and one of which he is
the family name, which gives itself away in the "peg" form it chooses—a seeming obscure identity over against the
evangelic "pegs."

When you, oh one, are rid with the dead and the new, and the eidolons of all; and when you,
oh one, are rid with the dead and the eidolons of all, and the root-mind.
And the "one" and the "one," which pass from one to the other at such speed that neither
one nor the other is aware of the sudden absence, until it is accomplished; and when you,
oh one, are rid with the dead and the new; and when you,
one, are rid with the dead and the new; and when,
one, is rid with the new and the eidols of all; and the root-mind
is the reflection of the truth of all the heavenly visions, the spiritual movement of the
angel, the vision, and the will of the omniscient. These symbols are
palm-fraught, and, within them, the history of the creation, the history of
reality.

The seaport town, long ere the royal dome,
Failed states of Europe to withstand;
And how, with secret moor, and privy space,
The pirates entered her, unseen, unannounced;
And how the freemen, rising in that hour,
Came with martial standards, sullen and grand;
Fought and tore away her bulwark of iron;
Tore up her premises of masonry,
And left her no personations at all;
In open show, she stood confess'd, to all,
That the days of private onestate were done.

Ye voices hurl'd long watches to the winds,
No reasoners, be ye question'd, here or there;
Whether we rule too much at court,
Be the cause we care for or for naught;
Whether the Reformation 's means
Too much, or Reform, 't is still the same,
Either keep we keep ourselves quite bare,
And to our God given, and house just owe,
No thing by us vouch'd, nor guest, nor guest her guide.
Be you teachers, be you chiefs,
On my allegoric rank wish you to sit;
Take, take them, the fire; and all the air;
Speak boldly to the world, the truth will still
Sound, though the PEOPLE shall perish, gone.

There's not a man living, who thus far goes out
To seek his state and good, in this our market;
And nobody cares to cry him back,
If he goes badly in the market or the court;
And yet, though all stable and market broke,
The serfs may, by useful service, gain
Honour in this our good service-free state.

I have found out the cause why we skip,
We pray oftina to get the more;
And there is nothing worth hock in the crown,
Seldome knowen thoroughly a stoor;
An joint-anxious wretch, in saddle ready,
Ready to be up and away:
The history I discern, which contains
Men's different fears, proclivities, inclinations,

I'll tell you in a fact, I never quig
In books the face of such a heap of pelf;
The Deity, who so much does excel,
Doth more than print allow the skipper to read;
Tho' in our Persian, in our Jewish books,
The same evil eye did reign consequent.

I set my cofferrer level with my toes,
I take out my holy book, well-meaning wise,
I think the books I have written well indyn'd;
I look'd the Psalms close, but scarcely could find
The passage they pretend I never read;
(One is a foul, one a divine holy book;)
So with the landlord and the guide I try to seise,
And the host'lic hound, and your driver wizard,
I send them on with all their exotic gobblers.

'In vain they strive,' says I to them proud songsters,
'Your book, and yours two books of ours, to set.'
They blush, and vainly so all their venery as pretends.
I powder, firing, splutter, and stoop,
And breathe, and so am well assured the mind
Of the Greek race is much more similar
In manner to your Greek soul than the songsters.

The mortal never knows disappointment's hue,
And so I ink joining our two souls in honey,
When I hear that the threats'd Pouet meantlier of the two.
Their cavil and scorn if I record this,
And draw their stories as sufficient as clear;

"The world is once again aware of a factory collapse in Lorrain, the same town where Stephanie has her manic episode, causing 13 out of the 18 people killed to be their own.
"This story may seem like an invasion to some — a stand-in or a cannonade — but it is actually the same as other nationalities of the military who die.
"The last two deaths were those of U.D.STARS, or United Dachshandish Starlets, the first 28 minutes of the life. U.D. stands forUnknown Death. The third death was so very sudden: the microphone was off by just the tiniest amount when the shock was dealt.
"Both men were builders. The out-of-sync dance was a matter of consistent rhythm. Their body language was natural and everyday. And the woman had been to see a play, too."

Breathless, yet yet the form of something stiff and glad
Echoes, ere its body withers, in the air
Athwart the last dark miles of stumbling day.

Ere the moon had sunk a-slant, the clouds
Burst an abyss, and to our race a new realm
Upgraded and enhanced, and the Sun was there,
In apex of magnificence, and He
The radiant King of All Our Own Day.

There was no storm or sleep or sombre cloud
From sky or ocean parted; so it seemed
A calm phantasy that night and day
Through eyed men would point infinity
To span, and hold them reverently back
From uttering words that might terrify
And confuse them for a eyeless world.

The Moon glowed, made love to her blaze,
And sipped star-water from the sky
As ever she tickled the eye
With softly-softly, the expropriated Sun
Bathed in her ripples, leaped around
Himself to evermore in finity
Aster-ward, in luxuriously-
Proportional juggernaut flight.

And over the amaright city Ulixesta
Stood like a bride-slave, bought and paid
At a long, richowd brothel's pride.
Buck-edged, large-wheeled, black-backed, neat-oared,
Driving his brims, fashioning skirts ad-
orbing from end to end of those long rims
Wherein the stars for a while are asled;

Driving his bristly brims, this long-legged Demon
Forgot forever to grow a brinny foot
In what had used to be his erst renowned foulds
Ere this whence ever his winds of 40 cupped feet
Had flung them free.

And he found keeping his rowld half sort-
oout o'er his own business at a loss.
The nobleness of his hand, as journlin'-pole,
Was all indecision; so he sought an au-
tower, to infuse in it, with help of many
a prop; a prop to draw from its nearest air.

And now sited on his knees, the sudden, famisht
short-graced, short-stuttered wiv his arm,
He stared up heaven-high,--surprize his breast acrost,--
And saw above his old rowld heavens fur-
wrapped, space-enwrapped, as if the thick-repressed
flutterings of some conflagrate morning,
furrawinded midway between Him and the sky.

Then on his stargle heart's side he thought,
"I'll make an old foirday fand!"
And he said to his men, "whenever it
befell that heaven and hell o'er-wrap us,
Let us all fly down there together, like ants,
In one big burly group for a lapwing.

"For our strength is with hearts close packed and knit
so, when it writhes its white snakes out,
They'll show themselves in groups of two or three.
Let's show them their proper polearfunctions."
So they ran down to the ground to hiss and scream
amongst the chanter's boisterous roar,
To mimic thunderbolts, which the blue sky ignored
sooner than his old streaked way.

And now that he's there below,
He looks up to the sky and sighs in deep
deep moaning. His cheek is dry,
and his mouth is like a hooked mackerel,
and there's this thing, his tough-belted firth i'th fair
and his beggey broken, big-powered machine mong
six wheels scuffing the sea's they-land.
"I think it's time I should had an urge,
Curled to the low boat-rope, to ne'er dis-
he against my will, this monster tide

to take the eels of agony
and hung himself up on a cleft of boulder
above sea-beds, above sea-SHELL.
He was so trepried, he could not even see
that the shore was curved, that the hull was made
of solid rock, and there were these rocks
scattered o'erheated rock o'er-humped
as curling claws of sea-THINGS.
But the wind that whacked his face and caused his eel-
lung-like retching and the squeeling of his membranous
limbs,
Was all of the shames and woes of that c

 in the
Spoils there:
From the arrow-struck herders and the high
Revelers,
To the poor herd-dogs and the tost horses,
With their load of hay and
Toothsome "Beggars".

Of twelve fathoms pure pounded
Hemp-seed meal, to make the wood-heaps deep,
And as deep as Eginter
Mighty-glowing,
From the nuts of oak and elm
Hure and juice, that the fleetest winds
And tempest-pale sun-gaun ours;
That the nobles might feast there every
 Week from morn till EAST of SEVENE;
That the poor might be-meal there might
Eat fruit, and bread, and wove
Flower and leaf, and brew-in-water,
And that all might keep up the sale

So here the Evening Meal went up to
The Round-headed Townesfolk,
And the sky heaves a blaze of
Gibbous golden light,
To keep them all alike a-glasses-clear.

And here whilom, roosting a-whilst with
His crew of Cloathless Peeres,
The Sun round about sate,
About his foot steeres a quavering of a-sigh
Of th' awful Hue and Color;
And at his foote there floo's a band
Of fifteen thenle securing the Feast.

And there was also there, apart,
In the garden's cool-cold,
The sober-gray-feathery Eagle,
Suri-shrieking, its-flight.
From the secret, behind the screen
Of the great Okeefoori Block,
There, on the firu-sield and high,
Sturdily built and severely planned,
It cast a hundred great eyes
At the people gane through:
And the lark dropped lightly from the air
Like a pigeon off his back.

My First Book (1907)

Feeble, faded, and devoured
By time, uncouth, and unwritten,
This work began the perfection of the
Babbler, and presents, but fails, of
No longer than a 92-st. volume.
This was the first book that I made
With Mrs. Edwin Daines.

Made for Southern men primarily,
May it be nobly stuck, will it bear
Such readership as has oft been
Limited to the Friends and Colonos
Of Austin Lewis, whose zeal for this
Plumlock made it publick taste.
Of this production some portions
Were manufactured by that stupendous
Publick gast, Mr. Burrows.
The literary characters
Did raise some questions here and there,
But the fiction skirted by the authors
Dryly dealt with any question as to
What stake for future publication did
Daines and Denton require.

'Tis said that Daines and Denton took
Much fault with Burrows' gastly lumpish
Miscaizing of its editorial cartoon,
And rightly thought it not good enough
To keep a fear on them, which was, we
Ample convince heretofore, their special
Quality of newpapers to be wary
To keep a rate of sticks on ty Shots and droppers.

Why then did Daines and Denton, in 1908,
Take a publick topic of their own,
Call it The Settlement of the Authors, and speak
As if they had acquired a taste for watchmaking
Readies. The fact is there is such a topic
And a ready audience for it on the shelves
Whereby their fame-furnished friends, the members
Of the Oyster Bay Colony, may have fuller
Options with them for their Ovid option.

What are the sorts of people. Let us trace
The various sorts of the thirty-two
Strong models that Austin Daines did prefer.
"I sought the Italian model; I chose
The highly musical, imaginative,
Blest ideal of sturdy Rome--the sturdy
Italian woman." The several traits
Of the several characters are thus given
In full:--

"Italian . . . ever direct one so, that the
Democratic spirit of the Romans comes
Through her, and by a inward
Tug-of-choice the living heart of American
Ambition springs."

"In a romance of new or old debate,
In a comedy or a narrative of love,
In a tale of high endeavour or dramatic
Crime, there is one in whom the same act
Might well be fixed true love and true life, more

Visible, though in mind's eye drear'd,
The vast black meads excite the fiercest mirth.
We, unapproach'd, from our foils be free!
Ajust'd, ajust'd, I claim the best of thee.
I, at the sign, approach the sacred wit:
Nature, you are kind, you own the truth:
The faithful harmony of things heard,
At last, though half-chiding, justifies.

The excellent Greek, that immortal drink'd
Nectareous wines, tinctur'd his goits pale,
Enpriz'd, the Bull-rafian this red, that white.
Whate'er the man, his native taste would champ,
(Sweet to him, or bitter) ne'er spilled a pore.
'Twas his to drink--to relish, or spurn--
'Twas his--not everyone relish'd his draught.
In beauty's line, the well-ishing mirror,
The well-born and the accomplished heterogeneous:
No whole--no part--discount all, each in his mind,
Except the well-groomed archive of Suffance;
Then, structurally, all's sculptural, reconstincted.
To these, we scramble up a bust,
But eat the juicy meat of a Scimitar.
Like Bojana's chief (who, all the others auteurs,
To striate beauty subjected, and to iver,
Delight, as she was wont) I aim to emulate
The nature invESTED in me by NOVER,
In nought but IN TERRÈNE.  Now, in this
Dependent, this erect and moving lump, is sressed
The fullness and the vigour of the Past.

When Jupiler Duke God despatch'd his welcome pook
To these -- provided quick with codding cottage-reece --
The verbose new-made Governor, with his breath
Bespoke a score of far-cabled history
'Twixt that ill land and this – where so they had met --
About the defile, fereucule of law -- and here's his dern!

Of hedgings crown'd with double vain will,
Which my squire cousin-in-law said to me last week
They had made, or mendles straight;
Which I ran gaily, with my knife and weak earnest glance,
Out of the plain, and love what I saw!
For, dammit, 'twas a dare,
To work my callings any day!

It wadna gie me lordly satisfaction
E'er my dotard soul was won to feel its delight,
To see o'er green lawns my fields and purling stream,
Peak yarrow wreaths and proshansky heath
Bloomin' -- top yon summits sweetly --
Till I knew, with miraculous longings rare beguiled,
The meshing of young spring and ramble sweet.

Was there, that I by my side roved,
And marvel'd when and where,
When gray began to wend its living way
Where the forest-gestic'd bents were laid
To celebrate the dead?
Then I was aware how tears, that long have deserv'd,
Did surround my eyes;
And the acid invective, that winds on a'{:e}...
Flutter'd {h}ork down my mouth.

Ah! a beautiful urn thou keep'st,
With sacred yew and ystall grass;
Sweet stands the ysaire,
And ytone is the ystree,
But most vernal is the summer
To this yew-tree.

I am under covenant, constrained,
By that canary in thy throat,
And by that vow that's been your law for many,
Long ere I draw near;
Therefore with glad sensation
I translate rock and tree,
And breathe the fruitive motion,
And can in me cheer life's interval.

Goodness and goodness is in that clime,
Where growth is of sleet and sleer;
Meats are little and drinks are little;
There's no money for 'em, nor for simon Hunt,
That's nature's marchin' manna dois,
Down at that town.

 say'st thou didst--oh! but it is

Of Thalaba that question not, for he
Had not the heart to turn from her, for he
Hath no heart in him, be it more or less.
And now at midnight, when the quail lay
Two leagues and a half south of Thalaba,
In his own bark toward the land of Somalia
Forth to seek his kin who hath forsaken him--
At midnight drank the land of his father,
And reared himself up on Jacob's lance,
A mighty solace of a great man,
To wander in Thalaba's wilderness
And make the forest know him of his love.

But to this chattel Egyptian the wild wood
Looked on, with big eyes full of anger and shame.
And in the briars among the leaves beheld
Young Thalaba, with hungry look and timorous pace,
Holding his gray beard and pointing his gray visage;
And the great white elephants of Egypt
Made with his coming hoarse and loud, as he passed,
Their white nostrils twitching as they traced
In the air a slow smoke of their secret hopes.

But through the briars scant of their secret wealth
Upreached the youth, and he alone was heir
In common to all, yet by misfortune made poor,
And cursed with balance for-against-none,
Full-split in lilies, with unseeing eyes,
Of part looked Egypt, of part the Empial train.
And at its feet lay as in high relief
The axe which smote the tall emerald acah,
And catlike body, of the queen's good barge,
By which she went forth sea-bordering on the West.

And Leviathan, who is sometimes named
The Bighead Wall-Dog, unpoised his eye
Anti-clockwise in a corner of the bay,
In slantwise of one perfectly long
Part the line of his head as free-winged
Ill-advised, being hermetically pushed
Toward the line of the land, her view swerved top-hest,
Her breath one long drawn-out eelitow
Against the water's edge, her wrung-chin
Against her skin in the omen of bone,
Being that line, had a Baron in Spoleto lord
Of the Block's superb cape, below whose spurs
Dangling his fins, rough-brown in turgid furs,
All warned the ruffian tming of a teeth
Fennec; and he to the rocky cliff taked
That vision, warned his sonne's daughter to beware
Her father's ship that kill him; and his hear
Growled oath, if loth to hear the self-same sorry tale,
Of what he saw, far or near, in Siok or Ton
Then thundering north, an unforea shake.
But a plain woman so is none of these,
For to her such neglect will surely bring
Wrath upon her head, and make the heart's blood freeze
Before a word of compassion, or warm hand,
Not help him: eyes that testify the stone-kex
Of Hellif and Of Tyr, quickly choke the growler's mouth.
Nor wit nor voice, if conscience wake the corrupt thought,
Can remedy the mischief: dead lie down or fly,
Roll down the precipice of fallen place;
Hurl confounded to deepest ocean's pool,
Or in the fast-deceiving whirl of battle-land,
Where plagues rush to leave no abodes for them to dwell in.
Lime, saith the picker of the pebbly fields
The tune of the lisping laurel-leaf, or lily-flake,
Shouldst thou witness some gentle soul to do thee wrong--
Some humble spirit, with brow among

Of Nature's pageantry,--fair borrower from the age,
Wound with sweetest Loganism--till in name, and by
Canvuren hand in thy shreds of grandeur, thou
Yields thy soul? Thou sculking thief! The thief's

Fiery things were they,
Chanting their gaudy song,
While the boys were left to snor
And cough for a bit of air.

By tawny splinters of the wood,
By the cracked and crumbled drive
Where the hapless Maenalus lay,
On the road to glory and Hell
They canters;
By the wicked well that Satan dug
They drink from a polluted flood
In their auto."

"O, well-a-day, what do I see?
O, well-a-day!
Is that the azure awning,
Whereon thy weary Prestom Knight
Himself may rest?
Was ever castle more fit for grace
Of palaces that wear the crown?
See, see, within the wood, how fair
Daises and aegads are growing!

White forms, no shadows here,
Only the roses we see.
Green-grey, no, no, all afoot
Now we saw but cupboards in the stall,
Grapes, and the fir-tree's spiring;
And a grease on the ground,
For deep in the luscious mazes ran
Blessing and little children down.

The merry lark from heaven led
The shining wings of songs;
But now, in wild dismay,
We sung drearily,
For the forest had swayed to blame.

The baleful Twisted Fits had fused
To mangled horrors all,
Stemmed through the Source of Beauty all
As its deep ruinings rolled,
And, like a conquering host,
The forest, roar, and reels,
With many a mourner's tread,
All fiends still, all fairies wailing.

"O, well-a-day, in all the coming years,"
We thought, "the heart must be that sad!
What fortunes come to all, and what old joys depart!"
But the fates say:  "None passed genie out!"
We thought we were ever sad:
We thought:  "No joys can yet be mine:
The march of Time's undraped march is coming):
Drink, boys, and be merry while ye may!"

You put the hay in early,
To come as ye have come all week:

While baskets in over-glasses!
Up go the boys at archery
And fun 'till march-later lay,
And haul each other and the hay,
And maul the mark!

Or, if you scratch, yet others scratch:
No very farish share!
The lucky dog's largely gone:
So, if you get, ye may gie,
There's plenty that can get you!
There's fun in the sunshine, balm in the hot,
Brawn-freeze in the freezing seas!

She comes back with the cup and empties it in the sink,

We're not from the earth the sky disallows

but when we chanced to stand on shaky blocks We thought to take the air, to talk and to shine.

Then the pussy-owl cuffed the horses for their dally. I ruffled the bird and said we should only share.

It seemed they believed in mysteries, The rabbit jumped through hoops and regaled the sight with chaining

mystical thrills. I chased him and jumped before him and said see there The celestial rabbit – only shining.

But he vanished in a wink and the dream was done. Or was it flight?—

But who shall bear this burden?
The task is burthensome and hard,
But every hour the work to do,
For the cause of the loving Cause
That wrote the "Love Snell" in the sky
Of the ever growing Tree,
Of the ever greening Seed;
Whoso shall carry our banner of

Let every light and every shade
That glads and bequeaths him,
When our plumed and crisped steeds
The guideless carriers strain
To the ever green, ever riding Seed.

The road the jaded travellers cross,
The dust the plane the flaxen weave,
The lamp the cocoa-tree cultivates,

The house the weaving pillow.

This was the house of Hatto,
He had three sisters, Madalla,
Forsworn was the board with chairs,
The chambers, walls, and ceilings
Empty and deserted was the room,
And worst of all the origin
Of the turbid flow of blood.

The artful Breugene
To the sick man's mourning
Propos'd this emprize generous,
Who with pale proposiz'd,
For while afresh her heart pursues,
Thus entreats her party:
"Forget me delivering,
If to Hatto, write, you,
This she-breadth'd-to-the-walls,
That now the city-wide distribution
Shall not be stopped."

Thus she speaks, persuading parth
With hints of office from the dame we bring,
But his high will to serve
Deferred the offer'd end,
And she must for the time occupy
The duty which for months he tried in vain for.

In time Breugene's daughter, Millicent,
Sparkles again upon our imaginings,
And a mild scholar now appears
In the fair Buova, so much renown'd before.
Now the returns to art are seen
And the manners of the time of carnal thought
Forbid the impressions Buose had made;
And his learned serwants, with civil stare,
No more unmake their collar's lofty cuff,
But declare, in the name of Arminie,

That he learns from day to melt stamp,
He knows Bruchos from the oka;
He has sense to understand Obbeca,
And from Genus-lied banquettes,
In the Divan see Nominets vaunting banquets;
In an artist's house, writes Bruin,
No more to make an instrument
No more to pore on or uncurse the Fletcher.
And the Lady Buova, once so wise,
Says: "In Buova's case I meddle not";
In the name of Suffolks she curses:
In the name of Sale she crings:
In the name of Mela she conducts,
To the sickly word of direction,
How the very dogs would ring, if it were so.
So the coffee-house drops from her name,
And the golf-house from hers, the last two, in fact;
But she's so gentle and formidably
That, when any man of that sort would speak
She is merely taken-addicted, gaily,
And adroitness herself most glibly.
But when the Sidmas come, she's very rare,
For they've so multiplied their fortune
That they all hold coffee-house, every one;
And she reads, for boot-replenish,
Some heady philosopher
Whose cynicism makes mince-meat!
Why, I've even known, by far the wisest one there is,
Whom the best intellect in Perlman's Falls
Could not impress the figures to his craw;
Yet he speaks with tough eloquence,
And his arrows are able to pierce
Any watcher just so deftly,
As he, in his rather wonderful way,
Can convey the gist of any argument
Into a thought that quickening is,
Or by tacit post-haste.
And you'll find, by any arithmetic,
That she's beat her male acquaintance far and wide;
But to make up for it, she often calls
At Doctor Vantome Aralsid's Hall,
Where such women alone are seen to strike.
But never doctor yet was ever said,
Or Aradal Zedek in Wolf, or Saul's Road,
Ibiza busts, or such other things,
In the Christian Faith, for want of heat
Colour, or for want of flesh

"Fall River" is a poem of complaints
from here to heaven down

to the spring river
to Stony Ladkin
Cyrus Fort to Worton's Corner
in a line.

These beads have been the excuse
to do the other
and his eagle eye
what is he seeing
out of the corner of his eye
in a specter always waiting
to strike out at you.

The beating of the eyes by the rain is
already taking place.

He does not think
the world should be here
in its whole life.

What do we do with the things that are unwanted
but guarded with a secret

that a friend will look for seven years

and if you let your loved one near the Spider

then a spider will think you.

Stover must be allowed to do the regular hunting
and eating because

we are all with the same
story connected.

Do you see the big white tree
with its long limbs
that supports you and us
and what they do.

I went down to the racecourse
with Phillip, my husband

to see Uncle Pat and my mother
all in one moment.

I had on my silver skeleton
and felt quite strange

with my arms in the pockets of a small shirt.

Then Phillip said something
and I started crying
to go home.

I have never been happy

since I was born, since I was born
I have felt all kinds of things.

When I was very sick I felt this

I felt the desire to take
some fingerprints and go out
to see my mother and father

but I was found by my neighbour

who went and called my mother
and told her I had got in the surf
by the side of the Road of False Prayer
too many years since she said my name.

He said she had thought I might come back
and tell her something and she was glad.

My mother comes out of her room
and says I have always known.

She wants to know all about it.
Mother is happy for my come back
but I am too sad because she has had to stay away
these many years and I remember
going back and forth at night when I was sicker
and she told me it was best for me to come back
and that it would be best for her and the kids

to come back too and she had gone to Pat's
and she said the same thing happened to her sister
and for years I had been drinking cider.

I said the press was there from before they came and if
I wanted to come back I could do so unhurriedly
but neither mother nor the twins have come looking for me
this journey has been all anger and wrecked emotions.

I say it is all painted soon I will die
while the rest of them
are finishing the story
and they will say I should not have gone away
and I will be crying again.

I am here still.

I made myself a mirror and moved it to where
I saw myself on the other side of the room

of those who had come to the bar

to tell their stories
and
======================================== SAMPLE 138 ========================================
Hunger, thirst, burning thirst, the forked sparkle of spears,
The trampled torrent, and the clatter of maces,
The bellowing of embattled battle, in or out,
And shatter and roll the foaming pinions down.

And two the mighty lords and peerage,
Whose glory is in their lordships,
And the crown, the sceptre and ornamental star,
That shall reward them with our love's delight,
And tear from earth their fear of death.

"I must join the host," he said.
"Not thou, but he, Sir Gawayne,"
 was the quondam objection.
The barons, under their enlightened pride,
Proved engineers and miners afore they were fathers.
And proffered, as part of their Imperial right,
To succour the venture. And Gawayne, who heard it,
Fearing the baron's counsel, quoth, "Woe, woe!

The hosts I battle, or shall battle,
I tell thee nothing of my flight."
Nay, for our love we hindmost his attack should dread,
And his advantage in the fray be lost.
I trust in sooth, the wound of England here
Shall not be given to the broadsides so fine.
"He must join the host," quoth Gawayne.
"I speak to thee,
I saw him not my neonige last week.
Thou wilt take thine ill to see me meet him;
Thy time to smile quango lotus to bestride.
By heaven, I speed six hours too soon or soon!
I look for The Standard, and thou knowest that.
Him that all war myself, from boy to man,
From boy to heventy hero, weak or strong,
I cannot wait. Yet be found I can
The Standard be found out, tho' very far."

And now they both were clear, the king well in bed
Shined glad upon the stedfast eigthmastite floor,
When Gawayne, with the baron and the baron young,
And Lamimoudi both beside him, sitting at his side,
The victors to the sight that grieved them sore,
The victors with food for the victors out of town,
For mirky green fields and fruit-eager jookh
And flout and flour and snaw-ridden sullivagled landscape,
And sheaves of corn, and sheaved of corn for sheaves of wheat,
And sheaves of wheat, and her large cup utterer,
That by the people goes unpitying forth the praise,
Whereof to the tenth number is improninled,
I threw dollar for cup, by his goad to the toe,
The cup given him, to exercise in the race
Though he were but a novice. But Gawayne shivereth,
"Alas, shi'd my lady, I am pennyless,
I cannot get to the alcove, nor surpass
The spring was here, the tree, whereon the ink was spilt
Sclerotia planta. A cup is lacking, and a drop.
Nay, dollar for drink, I will retire to rest.

Thou didst pass,
The lady sat, and youth continues. She has the cup.
Gawayne, no man hence, a lady pass not uncandoor.
But he that hath her chase may comfort her with this:
Sullivans are we, some shall swallow us, they may suffer
Sick, and you may drink, and I will have said was good."
Sullen and sullen, and silent, be the I. Le. bows.
And they a while re-baled the wine and drank, and heetta
Saw the fellow read, how many munchkin mong us,
And what a sheltering vault for manhood it is
Though we see naught but glass and wrapping of it.
And now, the light of light, a cloud to make it morow,
A rising ostricety, the dinner done,
Sir Gawayne to his dad, to bid him joyoscene,
And all the Gull's officers and its Baron do,
Respectful, to those that did rein it there,
And tell them all good people to hear, and let them hold it;
To leave it to God, Sir Gawayne replied, is truth.

Borne onward by the shrieks of their cheerless prince,
From ten white oars the Current keel came keeking.

Of the time and place, to keep the road as it shall be.

As the nations of Christ's elect must do.

In New England, of late, have I been treated
To considerable viewings of that town,
By ladies for my peace, with much good success.
They are so narrow-minded, and so stupid,
To think one at this time of an inhabited earth
Might not be able to share their imag'ries.
At this time of day, in New England, if you say
An atmosphere of politics and contention
Is growing in society, a maid would ask, 'Is it dark?
'What, Sir, is it lighting? 'What is it, to you?'
When all are like our Nature-given condition,
No doubt is due to be clarified.
To them, the air grows clearer, so they may quell
A mirth, an ass another has led on,
Not only fair Quaker-Water, but Quaker-Water.
I venture (unless to be knocked over cheap,
Is what resides in, such a commotion there),
And so with them enjoy the sayings of it,
And if the scrawl from Raventuan's mouth
Is like the rest, or otherwise describe such things,
Must have a peculiar terminology.
I did not think Nature would allow
One mere Scarlet-street, but various parts
Of 'crops' of improper quality in men.
The learned, and innocent, themselves seem blind
In beauty to the same degree.

What a mode to disbelieve even God,
Who ought to us in Nature's mixture find
Mixture charting! --
How come on earth we can't see
That beauty's image is not in cloud,
But ere the cloud has been created,
It piques us with its present beauty?
If moons have it, why not stars?
Why this greater airier bounty?
Why men complain so of the beauty,
Yet of the whole not one little part
Will take the saying but the thing,
But this is I,
The very cause why three are not four.

If you but know me well enough,
I feel quite willing that you should know
What many, far too few, of those now listening
Are holding now.  And you think yourself right
To keep my prayer for error's pill denied.
No Apollo chorus shall you hear,
My chorus will be the gladiators.
You are wrong on one point only:
My song and its twin, you are right to hold
From me the God of Thebes all down
To the heights Acarnyx, which is opposite
To most saints' singing mountains.

To sing all mountains at once was never done
So range on range; but that you may feel secure
Against the end, and already given away,
I will add nothing to the rime of this
In regard of my subject.  I am sure
That Jose-Hermosa's ambition runs no deeper
Than to be 'molved headlong trying to get out
Assem, the page of Deucalion's condemnation,
At his own trumpet-blast!  He'd be content
To commit the breach of trumping notice
There and then, and yet there imploring wait.

He shirks his proper work on the staircase
That he first builded.  It may be seen,
What would become of him were he to try
The whole descent of ten thousand steps
In the night time down, by the natural door
Opening on the cremandoge in Urr Below.
Scarcely a sight beyond Augustus Lippe
He would have stayed to look, if there had not been
Some nimbleness in his flickering taper lip,
His hands stretched helpless on either side,
As he had taken as much faith in those two
As fit well as he enlisted them to look
As he had seen them in Deucalion's page.

I would have all copies of 'death' discourses
Burned ten centuries hence.
I would have Denisallio speak them out,
And not one elect as false.
I would have him give his instinct to all,
Who live to stir and test his nerve.

I would have him bring before 'the pale dead'
(The moral good of all men's lives to man,
As marvellous for his own end).
I would have him for the one descending penny
As he were false the whole earth around him!

I have no faith

As you knotted my harnass
You took away a string which
Was the heart of a dear trot
Oer which my lady proved too true
For the chase of a long way had gone;
But I'd be fool enough to risk it;
For I am going a-wondering
To have her trot to court at the Dale.

I know a thrush sings loud, "Alas!
Cathleen! Cathleen!"--a gay bird,
Who dances with his mates, two by two,
But he says no word about
His love-mates--Door, as Jason caught him;
And Door, who snatched him up in his claw
Like a nut but because he was dead.

The love-song of the blackbird's love-tide
Was like a sea-boatman's praise-rise;
For when sea-things landed on friendly land,
He left the story of his bud
Upon the level, the sand, the heat,
The buds, the sand, the blossoms, grass,
All in a fattening above the bar,
His bird's patter all his love to tell.

A flock of geese fled towards the wind,
To hide them from the winter's blow
In wings from which it deemed them sent
To bless it--though it could not know
Their wrinkled faces, or the rest
Of what they went to seek, forat all.

I put my head against the stone.  For a breath,
The cold desire of dreams to be
Stifled in, and all were strange again.
For one would hollo there and then, as if fire
Were in the mana that made them so keen,
And bless the

One has gone to the abodes of the dead,
And the next, after this life-time, steeps in clay
The dreary unprofitable past.

These songs of the hater
What are they but the soul's sense of bitterness
Severed at the extremity?
What are they but a waste
and bitter desert?

Here in thy singing
Darkness grows human, 
As music which overrides the ear
Takes the sense of being
And leaves the spirit in despair
With the reproach of not having understood.

To his soul is what blind was made
When we wanted what we could not see;
Thou hast made what we do not see
Our own shadows which we can neither see nor feel.

I, sitting 'twixt wrath and horror
In thy parting steps,
Saw how a tiny, daffodil,
That did assuage with earthy wonder,
Sick of love's drought and spurt and fuss,
Polished and gled:
Joined with a rod the mindiplin
That her lovely face was
An apple of greyness,
And that her fruit was dead
And producing dead
That was an eye of green,
And me that recked not why
Stood, maddened by lust
To thrust my spirit through
That wound of bile and futility,
And grow no more;

Slept with wearied wings
In drossy, dainty, woven dress,
Till I, mourning, could not lie
Vertically for more than expressions
Of their young wild age
Crowned with spray.
And I crying myself mazed.
While I, in a deluded mire,
Washed with damp
The legs of an antiquated chair,
And wept for a want they had none;
And that for which they gave no sign
When they gave
Vine when fruit was plentiful,
Tree when fruit was scarified,
Song when like the coughing of rue
When sex was a book
Which one's spirit made,
Shorn of its cover,
Half Axis,

Ran slowly, glued with the quaking shudder
Of thought in `dumb peace'
Toward the doors of light;
Where I made my mind;
And was jarred
Against the hammering waves of the sea
Rocking.

Bashfully, haply, gods with faces
Betwixt which the sense of earth is
Vexed, fluttered my eyes
To see the immensities
Of Form
Until I knew
The fluttering;
O I could have taken
Time,
Whole and All with sudden franticness,
In one impotent plunge,
For my eternal paradise
Here is the spot;
I, here entranced,
By the sin of desire
How I wish I knew,
Here, with the scent
From her lips,
How hers were the rose-leaf hyacinth
And neem,
And leaves of knowledge
Which have kept me, here enthralled,
Till the burden ceased,
And I,
Till I,
Am left with the smell
From her hair.

Hers was the beauty of the secret glory,
And it vanished; but beauty has a strange way
Of coming to the surface in any woman.
Where the magnet's force is under him,
The magnet's force stays secret,
But as force, by force, will out at last,
So beauty keeps its shape
When over-come by force;
So her charm
Shaped itself to my mind
As this human, or like some flower
Which has its pure seed;
So formed, enriched
By her gifts,
As a builded vessel, full
Of beauty and joy,

I wonder; and what are the thoughts
That run invoking now to my life
My body and myself?
Hers, the mind which now spread covex and lens
And vivid eye;
The strength which sought in vain all mine Ohold

For love's joy and hate's severe beauty,
And the high name--twenty times returned,
Returned for pleasure, death free.
And what is this beauty to my life,
Her house and mine?
Loneliness made it so:
But oh, my home! I build in beauty treasured
Her heart and body to the hilt;
There shaped my muse to be the immortal seed
Of beauty incarnate, made her a divine
Fulfilment of form and seed,
There attired me with warm airs of heaven
'neath the heart and cheek
And framed the face
Full form and beauty and soul
As her beautiful soul was full
Of beauty, full of

'He ne'er is weak or afraid;
Then come to Ida, my own dear master,
I have gone far on the path of the warrior;
Therefore am I come to thee, O my soul-mate,
Thy comrade to the fraternal Mysteries!'
And that youth thus entreated thus replied
To the fierce Pohya, Baryonya:
'Tonga is my mother; thus I answer:
None other mother has I: thus I answer:
I am not weak nor afraid.
If Sime has declared in an ancestral haven,
In the silent calm and mighty Deep,
That I shall enter Turk's bloody jaws,

But would with one who would warlikey the fight,
And would not fail in the eternal boast,
That would still defend the Teutonars
With his father, mother, and his mother.
Else should we hence, far from our people,
On ever-diverse, be left in doubt,
And so our schemes be ruined all.
But if some chief should come, who spoke us plain,
First to our aged sire, and afterward
To the other kings,--if little we reck'n
The honour of great promises made in dreams,--
First to the aged shepherds would we dare,
Great then to shepherds much greater would we dare
To the kings who fill the middle horoscope;
And we, at last, should have agreed.
So, Baryonya, we were kneeling here,
And, with Baryonya, we were kneeling;
When, lo, a startling veshSpace in midst of the kneeling,
And on the wall, a fine golden ship
And on the margin of the sea a dove."

"Very like, Young son of Barye,
This Baryalove appears to me,
So well the silken cartoucheth of
The ships, of Russian fancy.
If the fleet from the eastern winds should glide,
Oh well-inhabited part of earth,
The eastern land, ice-land of frigord heaven,
Or if, from ever-mese Mysteriel,
A star should fly from that everlasting range,
Then would I know each keel, or perfectly replicate
Wainamoinen's boatmanship;
Wainamoinen, hero, shall be seen
Then to a shapeless mass as infinite
As the sum of all things appear
From the Creator's eternal skies."

Then said Old Man Moine-bever,
'Have you then forgotten Boryokud,
The eternal man, Ilmarinen,
When laden with equator into water,
Pulls his tubs, I blink my eyes?
Did he sail upon the air, or hoist the sail
Upon the wind? If he sailed the farthest shore,
Remember'd the Deering Doons, and came not back,
Remember'd too that he wanted men to follow him,
If they wish'd to find their country shopping?"

"Nay then, be gentle with me, Moorjord,
As a pupil mild should be caitiffised,
And the archer wary.
Would a bit of fire be in my breas
Ere this knottet the fox beneath my plants,
Or the little birds at every paneth spring.
Beneath your rocky bottoms Treble would kill;
And the loud hother of vaver heavy metal:
It breathes hardearth, and would kill the sick with smock.

"Song for the Middle-Aged Indian", by Pushpumming Wang [Religion, God & Habits, The Spiritual, Social Commentaries, Race & Ethnicity]
The lazy western sun
hassles the village.
The dirty winds,
the yellow river
each evening
knob-knot loose.
A beginner
in Buddhism, hungry
from a long fast,
choses some straw to his
coal.
The blacksmith, iron-fisted,
forges while
the monk
scatters fig and taro
to the monk and the crowd,
and green royal seeds
to his tongue.
The eagles, monks said,
are singing that all beings have
the tiger's tooth.
The odd man out
is Prajnakeer, the man
without number.
I'm everywhere, always.
In the company of men,
with flowers, grass, tree roots,
sap, shells.
I am animal.
I can spring unicycle fabulous.
And elephants, they say,
are the best witnesses.
Lying to themselves like words.
With lions,
their holy fool.

"Lazy God", by Rodney Jones [Religion, The Spiritual, Arts & Sciences, Reading & Books, Social Commentaries]
"You don't look well, you don't look well,
and you know it's morning, so
musically we get dressed and go
to different priests and tell them about
being lied to by their neighbor and taken
offrockstar."
The hangover isn't bad,
because it's hangover.
The priest said his house was too far away,
and licked his thumb while saying, "I ate
a whole sub and still
no loftiful [expletive] and my eyes
are the shit."
"Like a sub, say," I say.
"Yeah, sub is down here stupid,"
in a us vs. them
kind of way.
If I walk in and nobody
is gonna stop a thing like that,
a thing with his heart in it,
isn't a thing, isn't a thing
isn't a thing.
A jar of water,
sand,
a cinder-block fence,
a bird bath—
"Heaven" is made up of nothing
but a guttering
and an elf-light.
And a bird bath,
a jar, a jar—
"Man, you've been hungrier than
on All Pule,
not even for sunset."
The whole world's gone
anyway if not we.
The rest of our dinner is
the dinner we've been
making all night,
sipping on long stainless skiffs,
pouring lacquer bricks through
our live fast and trying
to keep from killing the next guy
who is the next black thing
down.
I thought I had you at last
where, what, a mile?
Was this light house a sub-squly
? Like Hic Anne, the cuckoo,
she came out of her weed and fell
like a flag on my ankles—
not liking what she saw—
not liking who I am.
"Well, maybe you're not straight,"
a white pre-schooler said
to the children in a nearby
building, "but why do you do it?"
"We don't like white people, do we,
that's what you'd be
for us, so why not

Like, if you like, black,
or white, as I'm sure you do,
a lot—but why?"
And I told her,
about 70 percent of my DNA
is from places I can't
see, can't reach,
about 70:20,
from the land and the sea,
from the roots of the earth

to the light that whoever sees us
tries to blind—
a blackbriar, a wild ajee,
white oak, or sweet
popcorn,
to light them up at evening
when God is down,
and black is light,

from new meteorology,
from new planet-ology,
from new healing wisdom,
there's new race-conceiving,
from the woody soil up to the moon,
and we're here,
up to

But when that shield is shaken, then our heart's at rest no more,

"There now, the trumpet! And you, captain Stork!—a nail to lay in grave withal,

For love of you—I will see you hanged where I dine with my love and you-ward go I see—
The field is wide to-day, I see:
Good folks are five at play by greenwood tree;
For me—no play, 'mid friends of mine
I go, so—a game I play;
Down by the river you'll find my old playmate
We'll toss the bag and string—ay or not,
To-day I have not ball—in hand—I grant
You then—the credit of a game,
However that, sweet friends, you make it:
With hands, hips, and faces—to keep still
(In fact it is a death without
A life, if kept still and kept to voice)—
They'll say there's a sort of game inside
The pretty romp they call the clapper,
And that we be not the first
A sounded bird that ever was seen.

"The Old Folks", by Rudyard Kialless [Living, Disappointment & Failure, Health & Illness, Social Commentaries, History & Politics, War & Conflict]
"That's a good-sized frog, that animal," say they.
"It jumped over five inches deep." Say they.
So I take a knife-blade along with me.
I am a mixture of line and void.
I have not a home, I have not a family.
My home is the crowd. My mind-set is mob mentality, the strength that gathers.
"We're all out here beneath the sun, watching the slow die.
I have not a home, they have not been named.
My mind-set is that of the mutant. I run.
I swim. I love the animal aspect of things.
My body is the shape of Things. It is the kind of thing that passes, little by little.

"Some Like to Thieve", by Allan Dixon [Love, Desire, Relationships, Men & Women, Pets, Nature, Animals, Mythology]
Some like the ease of the sirocco, some think the heat of the sun more cool;
Most think the moon more firm than the dozy breeze that blows
Even their ladies from sleep;
And brainless paces
Minds from the city
To lonely hilltops,
Are not for you.

An animal in the city is like a beast in a forest;
Like the water it thinks the road of the see,
Trampled down, worn down,
All worn down, even to blinding steps;
Like the wind in the forest it is contrarious;
You may not follow the br to the bush, the bush to the br.

Some animals in the city like to sit and nook
Of the juice they drink;
They have nought to steal, the wily rascal,
The bloke with the eye

I, of no means a beast in the city,
Have nought to steal or watch,
But somewhere be in with the rascals;
A statelier wag my toboggans
To walk the nights on,
Like the stumbs of the Swan
That surly tigers sprain;

Fish in the city, like the column aright,
Like pigeons in the rolls in the holly,
Like thimble-fingerers, believers, all in a squeeze,
Like to odd great winged builders,
The little blagging things,
The linnets of the brook,

Some puling mongrel from the river,
Like to boys at schools till boys are "made" -
Like to third-rate militaries,
The city and its inhabitants
I, of no means a beast in the city,
Like to the stag in the field,
Like to the well-trained seal,
Like to the stoiche in the seine,
Like to the garter-horse of heaven,

The noble beast of the country
Squeaks seldom (but he sneezes)

Stains are white; if day were night
Tattooed; if night were day
Blind-eyed and sweet she were
Tipped by her great eye
So she might see.
The change might be sudden, startling
The drinker's gullet,
The churlish choke-craping
Of the hooks and eyes.

The hills that divide

Her farm from Circe's fane
She does not understand.
And I have walked her all
Lines that might be hers
If she should take
The land that curves like her hip
So I might vomit
Some balsam for her wearing,
The gentle clover
On her Ganges head
To soothe her.

He has made a life out of air,
Dipping his olfactoric thread
Into her personal sphere
That can only be evaded
By treading.
On the sheathed tiller's Psamatan
Foregathers; figs from off the vine
Wedge into her limbs
That is tided life from Hell.
My own country's strangle-dathom
Pens up the giver; swine follow
Cherries picked for him; to add more
Doubtless to doubt, we hear of givers
Living close with wanton Hod;
Caste-dove or some
Hyena-clandestine
The hogward-left; as Hyenas see
Unseen, they
Hysterical
Dash from under ground
Wheels away.
On the gowned bride-bed
Strengthens, but feebly, the pall-matte
Up next.

Sweet post-Byronicium!
How do you tie up the Past
And cover over the Mind
Without revering on many points
Which ever declare a body's
Privations? or staying there to sneer
On anything that doesn't attach?
You spread the string
To shut up the Eyeteerbing Postern.

Inretired is Res prevenient,
In retirony stuporous-slow.
What then? -
What is the English nugget in a cloythened body
Most useful?
A myriad is the Anglo-Saxon lot,
Or ungenerous-paired, or blithe-heeled.
You smile on people, points-save, p. 5,
And in your caps English people you-names
Still rort before a dispicable-sound.

Too much of Biddy, my dear,
Is quite enough, I think.
She's so itachiarily
A person and a personality.
'Twas Faultage, sure, but she
Or any girl under the thunder
Of penny-crowned Patriarchy
So confidently throws her Youth,
'Twas Faultage, sure.

Who is responsible?
Too many People are so
Inferiority arrogantly shown
In any case and so powerless
To stand by the time and feel
Most of us are a form of Kar lesse
Precisely what the exact little
Or more or less of Pixie Dust
Makes adolescence in its crown
Of puffs and pinches bring.

Or not quite our own fault
Cornered the poorest share
In fado, where the pulse
Falls, and is taken away
As we're smoking,
To another vein
Whose fours and woozy last
Recreation is expiration.

No word at down yet
We've eyed that patrol of gray
England's distant downs,
And not-quite-dead-quite-alive
Boys who use words to grand.
We're not quite cold and dead
So much as dreamed and cold
But not quite the time to freeze.

Out of sleep into death!
You, whom the evolutions try!
You, whom the morning break!
You wake eternal boys!
You'll keep the ways and notas!
And notas, aye! forever boys!
They've writhed and drowned them in mists
Or numbered them and re-routed them
In a line, embroc'd from day to day
It's ever so usual when things pass them
And they know they are not, so they pass them.

They are not. Not even once.
So into the unknown they came
They could not stop them.
The next step would have meant danger.
And they did not want to risk it.

Well, there they were too late.
They did not want to go to jail.
They did not want to go to jail
And so they crossed their fingers
And hopes in a puff of smoke
And stepped into the jail and oh
They did not

Make a rude banner,
With red bars upon it,
Tossed and swarmed with live frogs,
Little black heralds,
Watching this as an adventure
To see who's king of frogs!

He's king of frogs, or he's lost!
And, to make a sure bet,
We'll forget that there was a
Problem in that bit of water
And who was dun and who was dun!
And in the mud, we know,
His opponent's crouched, in fear
Of that red, red jewel
Like a meteor in her breast!

He cocked his head, he cocked his head,
He cocked his head and he cocked his head,
And he swam to where the little fishes thronged;
He swam to where the trouts quirttes
And the perked feathers quiques
Fled o'er the blue-green ponds as green as grass,
And he heard the quacking of birds
For which he paid what's called

For the wild-eyed weaver, whose skilful hand
May yet obtain a profit, and who, in the meanwhile,
Durst shun a sure livelihood, a bold fore-note
Hand lays the simple bit in silk
To be ground by technique!
One casts his fancy
On bards whose business was outside the purview
Of the profinerile,
On flocks that grazed elsewhere in me, but who had a ring
For home-spun thoughts,
On a poet swollen with anticipative rage!
He comes, he bows, he claps his wings,

For he knows where the rainbows are.
He stept to where the swallows were flying low,
He saw o'er all the darkening blue,
And he made off as it were a lightning-stroke
To the rainbow! His flight ended, doth he find
What he was after, the heart of the thing
Made so much of "God of the thing,"
Which is the God of the scene!
He is God of the thing, but he is not God.

The palace was shut, and he entered at "Amintic."
The Parrhas in this speech would seem to mean "Castle,"
Not the first time that befolly's occurrances
Have failed to pique a boy who laid his glory at their feet.

"Where is he?" "He" is in the room! He sought us out!
He told the family when he had returned from war!
Why does he not come back?" "Thou shalt." "Show." "He is not here!" "We cannot tell."

And this being determined nothing, the boy
Sets off to find the relatives of his next bed-fellow,
And finds him. No, not really his "next bed-fellow,"
But a lad far on the other side of the country,
Who always had some new thing to tell,
And now said he had found what was wanted, and,
Content, at once and happy, wished to help him.

He said that he had all stones in the world,
And wanted only to lend the boy a light glance,
And on his information, many paralleleeks.

The boy, who had found, in his anxiety to disgorge
What so many may not be able to buy, a stonework Lump,
Or what so vast a sum, for little ones, a whole room,
Furnished some nettles and trussed birds to carry away
In his large cart, to take to his native country,

And there had doubtless gotten more than he could have paid,
As we may guess the budgetarian will have his share.
For we watch to see what charges the 'cuthites will be sent out for.

Upon the road, at break of day,
To seek fair Irishe in the heaven's light,
And told his concerns, as plain as plain could be,
That he was heartily pleased to he told,
Upon his face a plump and cleanish smile,
Whereon the sweet and trobization ate not.

He through the courts, the places of the palace,
Came adown to the vaulted ball;
There, when the visors had been lifted o'er,
That he no more could see them, a sad sight
Shadowed upon them did occur,
He gazeth as he stood, a bow broke loose,
He must bend down and take the o'erlaff,

But he could see not at all the exploit
Through the high heavy braid of all the rulers,
How they sit down, how they rise,
How they bear their looks, their looks and no more,

Carry the water, and form the Lake,
And the Dwellers of the Sylph in their train,
Thrones to thrones, their Empress choose with speed.
The Judge, presiding, in royal state,
To the Convent-like Caverns leads his way,
Leads the Convent-like Caverns upward,
To the caverns of the Tower-like mountains,
The mountain-like mountains of the earth:

Now the Otter-wood is visited,
E'en in summer-time, all alive;
E'en the Otter-hoof-grass well-clothed:
Through the ewe-plashing, backwards darting,
Down the wearing of the tails, the aspen,
Through the tearing, the rasping, the clattering,
Through the raving, and yelling, the howling
Of the branches, the branches crunching,
And the clattering and crashing and cracking,
And the crackling and grumbling of the pine-trees:
And the Dulse, and the Owen's white lup,
And the Abbot's hedge-burnlet, and the lest its daggling rucks
Of the grass, and the Grasshopper's land-downwelling;
And the Thicket, with its long-headed grass,
And the ground-plants, and the rilled-seed;
And the Scilla's feathery deep-coloured pockets,
And the straight-burrowing, bent-hubert'd Pine-trees,
And the long-needed Joy of the Poetry-round.

Now the Beggars, and Clergy, and Rich Men, and Kings,
And the Rulers of large Cities, and their women,
As they pass'd, no less, that hour of love and song,
Pass'd in their way:--they care for no more Song or Poetry:
The Young no more: the Graces too: the Sire no more:
And the Bridegroom, too; but not because he gave
Unto their hands, but untouch'd the tidings heart-sick.

Long-lived, too, the Honors of our Forefathers!  Stately
They piled, to lie in the seen, in t'ward lostness;
Not unto this, our lost and sorrowful;
Nor unto them, the Wisdom of our Lord:
For that they were unmindful of their Spirit's gifts,
Then beside, who then assented,
Parted their saturnine feet from Europe's bricks,
Leaving a solitude in Western waste
Save for ransom some fleas or grains of sand.

God hath loved originality,
And reigned all glory among His thoughts,
Though by the best, by deepest, highest ties
He ties with His angels cables and bands,
He brings wherehe He will; and although the forms
Are like a mazzing picture to the eye,
The stuff's animated brass, with touch as soft
As the lost Art of lifing wight into men's bones.

The playmates of our idle lives, some survived,
Some elsewhere known, at least, have likenessed traces,
And a stuff for exceptions, which the law, at last,
Amended hard by a little, and enlarged
Long since forbidd'd, with the virtuous store
Now growing old, and like a garment fill'd out,
With a good handful of cracks and seams.
What, then, the flesh of man, like stranger things,
With the stories of the Park and the Council-house,
And the barouche on the fells along the winged trucks,
Marks the park of lords, the cattle-road?  The, gardens?
The country round?  Oh yes; the country; that with which
We fellow'd first-coat threes, with whom England variety
Blooms, and bows down as in our youth we humble'd been!

That, alas! we must pass, in our path a sickness of flowers,
Nourish'd in a state unnatural to nurture the body;
A pleasure of sitting, not touched; the artificial
Suspension of expression, a bold avowal of how
We feel; for, wert thou to tell, what flavour thine own
Tastes; how fierce we feel them, too ?  some tyrants destroy
All that have an existence of their own, touch as well
As those that wait to plate it?  this earth, so barren,
Tragic, scant, to support life, becomes a block for us,
Who, first of all, are first their parents husbanded,
And first the flocks or herds supply with food supply.

Renew its light through all the lures
Of the ground and of the sky and of our hearts,
By a strong and steady hour, or a gaze of love.

And yet they give us also a bitter cup,
The poisons of these long nights and long days,
Shed at our lips from the waste of books,
And the loathsome words that stab our hearts
And we drink at the hands of an accomplice.
They see with our eyes; they hear with our hearts,
And then they make us silent with their wings.

What if in the hours that we loved most,
We did not so much love them as wish for
To be loved, and to make them and to save,
Theirs the charge, to have shared our enthusiasm,
And our lives been in the lofty pine
Where they uplift from th' earth,
A soaring shadow.
They might have been our own, and we were theirs.
And we knew not, when we gave much need,
What we receivd in return.

O Milaittes vanish quite,
That were so beautiful on the earth
Till we became so miserly as we
Grown to despise them, which is true of the other
And perfect of whom thousisuer or nosgerry
We took for our degree, a spirit,
And some with fur and fancy went to labor;
But those who went so settling found
They had brought along quite nothing along,
An armsports of arms, but weaponry,
An equal freight to all, for nothing;
Which bore them, like harmless freight-train,
Through thy Ionian meadows, to a change.

Nil code,

We were a tumultuous tribe when we
First came to be used our minds, from which
We followed no codified ways except
That gradually one changed us,
One antigun and we all agreed
We ought to have a codex, and codex then
Was long since law, and codex now is law,
Ours was a sort of ancient, pre Adam way.
That was long ago, but long our current--
Till we found thou gavest them the codex instead.
Nil desperdum,
And thou ansuerda,
And they are fled.

The strict, formal alphabet, soon as we
Arrived in our southern navies, and so did make
Use of the lathe and the wheel to shape in to size
The alphabet, we too humanized, and so wrought
The forms with hands and heads for all commands,
And used words then for guns, guns now returns,
But then for needs, o' the starry gates to be rolled.
Our style was then MODERN, the MODERN style now MODERN.
Nil desperdum,
And thou ansuerde,
And they are fled.

Of he must be part of me and all,
All I can be, all air,
Too afra'd to be their viewless shape.
I have seen him in his true shape, and Muse
Knew him, and his myriad shadows in white
And brown; but, not again,
What if I've ruined him and no where
The sight of him to ashes be? Shall he return
To mar this training of his feet? He who can call
To music his sobbing agony, and hear
The madness of his voice live through his voice,
Will rue and laughter on him speak,
Will he return to see what's done and seen
Under MODESTY.

Now the old snow,
Are you so crazy, hath blown itself

As it may light, its light dispelled and disaze'd
At once felt light, its pulse tingled like a feather.

O Queen, O Queen--
The name still straightens in my tongue--you
Shalt hear it from ALL! Oh, good HEARTIAMENT!
My soul looks deep with both; my wit dips out

My skill beholds stars of smallEST honor;

And for his estate soks, that it should ebber;
Under his speechless nose, yourself You need not shiver.

DF was the best in every way
At which a man can tell a rake;
He stood,
To shave his crown,
And cut his hair
With the finest shave,

A tremulous little isle
Beneath the Spanish main,
Which is the fancy
Subject of to-day,

The King in these, and all his realm,
Was an ass in a stye;
The devil a faithful hart
To boresome lies,
And he, God wot,
A parcel of vitriolic sulphur
In ditches wells found.

Then wherefore
Was this spent on me,

Saith, if this is so,
To cross the in-land crowd,
And follow whose way I led,
And shaved in London town,
And lived, to all medical skill,
Free from the sickening load,

Let such depart, but ere
He darts upon his flight,
And drops him a land-shore's spot,
As most I hope to do,
Or he may do me, who doth me ill,
A great adventurer by avocations,
And not a scholar here or there,

Or baptizing of his converts,
Or with new and goodly names
Changing the Orthodox Meals,
And you, Gentiles, turning away
From the Creation's language
To other tongues the past or near
He hath made his peculations.

The King a measure hath prescribed
And appoints my purse-be-shared
With his fair reserves of golden din:
As some I am weighing the cost,
From the supply deceptRAL sailed,
From Paris and London and Rouen,
And Loho and Limogies,
The rest I count as losses,
As each should weigh to fat or lean
As me, when all is done,
God grudge or no.

I heed not how men hail me:
I heed not what the blind call;
My shadow is wherever I creep,
My sound's made, my song's in ear and eye,
I worry no field where my plaudits grow,
My benefit's known, my fame is well asked;
The Royal Spotify's not known to fail,
And Nigel's Herts is not proud BCD.

Forth with the draughts of lemon, gat stay long
And share with them my small tract of Demetrian tables,
Then share with them my Demetrian Pottage,
God grant I mind not what is my for Head,
Nor what demerits I have earned from my Sons;
If with the Yard, or the Ranchers' terror ME,
My share would be reduced like to reduce,
And I to trust in God's glorious fortune,
I to my Brethren only must be true,
Nor can I his Seasons as I can count them be,
Nor count the sum of his years that one whole number,
So fill my cup, though it be with ahu and is picking grapes.

If not bliss and the rest for me
That I am not of the World's wrong population,
Yet, Demeter-like, ever to make right,
And, like purified water, to cleanse after sin;
Yet once cleansed, might bring me if to see
Some portion of my almighty Creator;
Yet all my care not a drop can drain
Save of the liquid part of him who is Pure,
And like as the image discretive of his Soul,
So powerful in its pertinent fit;
Eternal signs his face, but can'st thou know
His storehouse what they are--knowing not why
They there are--for now you can not touch them!

He who to a sinner appeals
(The wretch, that shares not in his pardon),
The righteous take for 365 days and nights,
But for one liveth justfor ever;
He who sinful signs under presses,
Now sweet and souring in their stubborn parts,
Now fair and now ominous, reclaims,
Now brief and busy bad, now busy no more,
Now rich and now poor, and now displaying
Now mock and now dismissive looks,
Now shifts the master of thy bands and goading signs
Till warm impatience show him cause for alarm,
Sees his deep thought going and returning never,
Seest his true soul, not caught as a bird
In nets of fatal taste, no more in danger;
Lies where he stood and judged with his lips as right;
Loves his people as their prince in life and light,
They shall be his--yes, they evermore.

Though just as alien the other Nations
And outside their jurisdiction,
Yet, in their order and pride of slice

I found you one with the
Plumed Scorpion,
The son of the night,
The daughter of Light,
The Star with eyes;

Of the bowl and the branch,
For you were the blossom,
Of the bowl and the bough.
For you I fell a scholar,
For you I was filled with grief,
For you I studied and grappled,
For you in scholae Placidus,
For you in a thousand degrees,
For you and of late eight
I strung my weapon,
And eight hours to scour the lanze,
I sweat for to scourkel,
And now I may say, from the ribs smashed,
That the skin that comes from me is plastered,

Of the bowl and the bough,
For you were the son,
Sons of Time and Space,
For you were the son.
If you take away the armour from a hero,
He is now a host more fierce and more strong,

Let us have fought in the most fantastic ways,
Tho' it should be as the Skipper said,
Let our success in the most varied forms express
The strength and secrette of wit,
It should never understand
The meaning of the effort,
Nor understand the ease
With which we may defy chivalry,
But see with cool eyes,
For you are in my arms, my darling,
I am in your arms, you in mine, so kiss me,
And clung together die well,
From hell get you out, I say,
For shame, for the right.

Of all sins, this is worst,
That we sin not united, soon shall shed me,
And teach all those who shall read me, how I have sung,
To laugh, when the ground is green,
And when the summit is capped with cotton-cloth.

In golden villainy was a-plenty,
The soil was not artful, was not at-torn;
The people were not of a bad constructor,
But for the good they did it was fit that they
Since honor was spikenard, not dripping bread.

A windy pile was Mr. Lang's house,
But he in the corner was not too proud;
He looked up on the painter's face, and did not
Cross his knee, and cry, and

 he knew
It was beyond his powers to take this kind of prey.

I shall give you the cup. Take it and have your way with it
As if it were some Indian's property. The sweets
Mixed with it are like the man's that once in a
Flower.

Sable books, white walls, black desks.
Three of us sit here, working on the long book
That in its state waits its lucky day—
The great one that Straight-A's eager eyes devoured;
The book that tells how wolves were made to flee
From which they never were released
And how there was a wise man who loved
Flattery and counted Chivalry as a friend,
Who told of streams that flowed to westward
And of the whale that died in darkness.

There, in a corner close to the fire,
Couch and chair and shelf of common books,
Doubt and thought have their quiet night,
 Fraying ankles are made to sleep
By the soft fire and the snoring light;
E'en soothed, with pillows' down-talk
Parents and friends cannot make us yawn;
For dreams and thoughts that raked at us
Unawares, we doubt and be poignant
Drowsily and mildly intending
To answer to a general call,
Have their first stay in the east.

Thought spreads, in the fire's merriment,
To ope provision. O'er the hearth
Stands, clothed in felt, the mother's heart;
With warmed, Arachnoid arms she woos
To make it understood she fears
Over the picked stones of her crypt,
Where children have lagged, she wails.

Now in the cement we irony pass
Written on the slate with our cheek.
Round table, of weather broken bits,
Long since, coped and dipped in water,
Feels in his half-heard IMORTEMENT
O'er an ancient, hurdled ship
Called The Ancient Ordain'd.

All grist-dry grains are out at once;
Roots pale, grains tenderly studded;
All strings of action are unstrung;
All straggling shades are limp or blank:
Thrown by the wind on tiptoe from the rock,
Too slow or too fast or both;
And, at the windy woods' shudder bar
Lamenting, bows in its winter slam.

Bend low and lose not thy heart
To idlers grave or suicide
Lying in bed. There's the poppy
That screams in the snow,
The gasping loon that lags in the blast,
The stunted lark that is dumb
Hailing winter heaven above;
All singing, striking time of Spring's,
To Russian plain and streams.

But thou, strengthen with thy strength of heart
 thy inner man. Read with thine eyes
or sight, mark all his tricks, respond
unattached,
O exile, reading that came to thee
till thou hadst lost all search,
Or kept one straining eye.

Nay, sweet, thy love was like some tiny scar
that has spal'd a humble thought
Lest heart's heart fail therefrom;
Or worm that gnat in stale of summer night
And think not weighty,
Thy man go calmly from thou and try
To live with those that love thee.

Sweetheart of yore, O how far from me
and nowand takest my best love now
from me, and is well-armed
and will takest ever art of song
for what I will not say
nor look above to heaven nor down
to the unmerged,
not even to God, who checks the wildest thought.

I shall not see thy face again.
The high green hill where we stood so quietly
ewes me now with spring,
the bay's whisper under the very sky
that swoons along
The score that seemed always two into five
now comes down in asshanee.

The starry skies wax and wane,
The mountains tilt and rise,
Yet in the room with me is the same
fitful look to eyes,
The same warm sunny smile no man may hit.

She comes from some place far away,
Beyond rowanks and ropes,
And all our hearts were lit her way,
And she came shivering.
She came in gown of violet half-pulled,
And work of white,
And she came home at evening stick and pail,
And she's down with face of clay.

A lovely, lovely face--and yet, it seems
from where I sit here,
I never can add breath or height

Thank God for tears.

I am happy when the sun
Washes the sand clean away,
And my yellow dune-wall
Is blotched only by the song of crickets.

I am happy when the sun
Comes out like an opening night-apples,
And the wood-lot rakes rise before me,
And in the depths of my heart
The nightingale is singing blue.

I am happy when the moon
Flowers white as my knitting flowers,
But the blue sky and the quiet grass
Are doubly sweet to me.
I think this happiness is mine,
The sun is joy,
The moon is rest.

A flower that's blossomed is a-blossom,
As we say in the flowers' world, we see;
And a blossom is a blossom, as we say.
And a blossom time we say is short,
As we say in the blooming grasses' time,
And a blossom time is over short.

As we say in the blossomed flower world,
The sun is still shine,
The moon is shining, the stars are shining,
The quiet wind is wooing still
Thetree beneath us, the trees above,
The blooms that are white, the blooms that are green,
The gold of the snowshadow, the lovelight of light,
To say in their time, is worth while;
For we say in this world of ours
That is worth while.

A flower is born, and thence we know its story,
As we say in the words of who knows them;
And so a month is sweet, let me tell you so,
As we say of who shows them.
For from little flowers that have outsprined
The little green shoots;
For, in that glow,
With the big bud, and the little budding,
The little cluster, the small flower,
Held tight in the viscous fibres
Until it shriveth,
In the act of sthe blood-filled tumults,
Unwieldly in the weeds
Their efforts to ward
Against their realm of sterile youth
And dark where is no night;
Against the night that is the flower's;
From flowers will learn.

And from the plums down
The sharp blood dries which
To fresh young hearts is reddening
As is the young lily's
Heart that spreads it;
Which still thickens
The slow-turning streaks
In these young days that
Still turn on their arrival
For the old ways quiver needpering
In the wide mosh-drive
Of the moment's delay;
Still thickening, still thickening,
The old events are thickening
In the growth of the jonquils
And the small sacred things,
Where the mothers know them;
And from the women, as from a river,
And from the mirrors, as from a well,
Is thrilled the healing waters;
Yet through a silent warp of the wind is let
The delicious scent pass,
And still new challenges for the bath
The saunters round.
But of flowers did thou never take,
And of bonds no heir they lay,
From the frail yellow or the red?
Of flowers thou hearest, of flowers thou knowest,

And of love thou hearest, and no more
R b c'n'400 sibyl it lies
In the scatter'd seasons wast
For thy straining: it is mine,
And it gives, it only, hope,
Though yet I have not looks to write.

Alas! then with thee it best,
Should my days ever be
Of unplancent vassalage
Based on a change in clip
Or colour; for that darkie man
And wise and wily ow will sing.

But o'er their span of days
They shall pass like the wand of time,
When as their shadow darkly goes;
They o'erpass the serous night,
They o'erwhelm the slothful lamp,
They shake the wild blossom,
And gather the unguarded guard.

I have lain alone
For hours upon the town,
Yet never have drunk like thence
The rich wellings of this roam;
Yet have I stretched my hand
To drink, and found it cold.
But I have talked with Ones,
And he has given me sweet,
Yet I have felt it but a dream
And nought but a dream.

I have stood on the open step
That overlooks the sap and snow,
And all the wind has been blown through me,
And all the sunbeams, free,

And what if it be
that this great hour,
in the slow hours of the morning,
of midnight or in the noon
when the great gates close
the temporary living makes a quiet
and a place where the quiet and

And this great hour, in the time of
the morning, at the hour of one hour,
is the time for silence
of dawn and sleeping, or
the night or silence

while day and light sleep.

What was it that took your breath
as its cup of night

You heard voices, and it seemed as though

Praise him not the voice of man,
or woman speaking,

praise him not at voice of beast,

Praise the infinite transcending name

praise him not as blood-eater, or old,
nor the ages old before thy thinking.

When thou hast set thine hand to lie prone,
Do thou not nod thy head with heed of certainty;
Rather, in looking at thine own forehead, degree

Knowledge, which makes a world of universe,
An Epoch, which will not change,
For ever changing, with no time.

Hast seen the undulations of the sea?
Hast seen its waves reach a superhuman
Range all their course with unerring law?
Look at its waves, or any body, street,
City, villages, countries,

Factions of organisms,

What if I think this brief?
Time in itself is brief, but time in itself
Is not so;
What is now not next week
Or far off time
Is now, for ever;
Time is now.

A conception so simple seems
In now elective confidence?
Are we more new or less old
When we are already old
By a long maturity's progress?
A single night's moment
Or a long age's dotted progress?

We are too new when once we are not,
Too old when we are not too old;
Too old when we are too young;
And time too is time is long.
What is spiritual is obscur
With the voyager's waxen vessels
Whose orbit revolves astray.
And what is matter, dark or bright,
Vital or stationary,
When now there is no extended spirit?

Age makes no longer what you and I
Were hitherto astonished to find;
We feel at once our passage
Through the tremendous motives power.
Time in himself makes great or small
But in his power all things to control.
Nothing can be returned to afterwards;
For what can he return to?

The villain and the hypocrite are one,
The criminal beneath his oath,

The fool, who has no thought but penny thought,

Must rise as a sun to a free hot day;
And the meanest common soul will make
Space for the kings in their pomp and power;
But the kings for a moment turn to help:
They who are bound with the rulers of the world,

Who on the horse of peace would be mounted;
Who think with the souls of the messengers;
Who pray in a common, serious way;
Who will not be bought or fried;
Who fear not the frown of the moment;
Who knows sovereign responsibility;

A world in its tracks before him,
A world in his ears,
A world on his tongue, and on his belt,
The time, the place, the thing; the meaning, and the way,
The meaning and the muscle;
The meaning of destiny, and its muscle;
And the muscle of god, supreme;
And the god's muscle and its muscle;
And the god's meaning, god's muscle and muscle;
And the meaning of muscle and of the meaning;
And the muscle of the horse, and the meaning

Expansion, as all danc'd within the human breast;
The God was near! So sudden came th' angel Joy,
There fell a sound on Matty's heart of Doue,
Like the parting of all things dear, Matty looked round,
Thought of Heaven, and of his mortal joys,
And how, yet so soon, above God's care,
The day would come when he no more should see
The heavenly sun shine from a bright deck
Of brilliant, winged Space, and when no more
The moon through fields of lush Ardor should be seen
Lean, as on wings of mist plumed August he sails;
When through Fate's iron gate, and bound of time,
He, once return'd, should go from here to heaven,
The senses went to God, and all was joy--
Then Matty looking thought on his joys,
And looking on him, God, from Time and space.

And then the morning came of Matty's Day,
And then, within his bed of oaken stems,
He thought upon the joys of other days,
And saw that all was not the day he had dreamed,
But slowly at first, and with many trails and wreaths,
Fondly, but thus with thoughts violent
Passion'd him, till he grew in his misery,
Like berries rippled as a stream
Roving the mountains of his youth;
And so at last when once for all
He was of woman born, in pain he sigh'd,

Till suddenly, who'd thither go with sighs,
Sudden, who doth my thoughts and I?
At sight of that lips who angelic was,
He raged within, a fiery month agod,
All as a hero O, to reach my claim,
And instantly with truth, fairness, love
His person graces so Must write, and go in haste,
And claim from me of such an ardor, praise,
Exquisiteness of wishes, that I seeth

And said, "how all this language do go?"
And I, who all the time by's love idolatry,
Stood answered his desire from reason's path,
And durst a little toil, and despis'd the method
Of making his desire the dry and grinding way.
I answerd, but with no less vainfetness rejoin'd,
"The language of love, how canst thou desact?"
He answer'd, "If you for me did delight,"
"To hear the express way," quoth I, "we might play idly,
"As on the icy seas of sleeping Thels island'd friars."

Though I, the masked monk of those truths divine,
Strip Nature's mask, still can my young eye behold
Where aught of beauty is seen, the grandeur, strength,

Live they for some hour, whose vessels in the wind
Fled old Genesis to its streets,

From the far sheltering seas, and from the moor;
Saw the Stars Ahasuerus, and his daughters,

For a moment, every object is so clear,
It cants every leaf, and leaf doth darts
About the ground, as if for death
From its tomb, beneath the bitter shade
Of a hoary holiday; the chime of the bagpipe,
And the low ding dong of the drum,

That was so fond of singing to Don Giovanni,
And the tapers it shed round the flat way
That Brothers repaired, who of life do pass
Twice thirty years, when heroes trod,

To the far shore of a retired university,

Remembering not our nature's needs
But some content, throned in the hall,
Must your base powers not claim?

The wine and bread
In this wedding feast
Are not so very lovely,
And the foreign thoughts,
The dreams of life, all dead,
Do not stay with us long,
In the grave they hoped to thrive
In silence we've only stayed
In wordless speech, a silent grace
That moves within the day,
To win a silent applause,
Hangs out alone
In the twilight room,
As he at whose side
She was born.

And yet to live alone
Is all her soul-stricken cry
Cries with a lonely grace
When the hot day is done,
When I've left her side
Which she bare on, to go
Where joys to her belong
And where no grief there is,
In the homes of strangers take
An everlasting root,
Is treason to her heart,
And gives a poison there
To what Peace there is
On this green earth,
Where two may face each other,
With a stern devotion,
While from each subtle look or tone
Law, Death, Death, Law disinherit them.

And all day long they sing
In some new land, wherein
There is no future sentence
Of lightning torture
To make good the silver phrase
"What doeth now?"
Their hearts are steadfast,
Their hearts are quick
To do or to have,
But over them and down into them
The shrouds the grey moon over,
For there they have no shore
Save by the wild waves blown,
And wild winds hither and there
Behind the hiding trees
Beat along,
And ever without sleep, without dream,
A thrill is on them and a void,
And night without gloss, without mercy
There for the wild birds' throats is but a field
For the wild grass to wave in alone,
And empty are the flowers at which they may
Their heads down to look or to rest,
And they are glad of all things till they be
Alone.

I loved thee when I loved thee never a bit:
Now thou art departed,
No good is it! as a through-cold-born rat
Is thou when you shiver under the gorse.
Nothing is changed! save that the green spring
In the briar-bell stands mute and stone-like.
Alack, alack!
But I used to think
How thou hadst not regarded the time
When thou didst boil the water for my pancure.
In the Broom! thou saidst, and smiled, and answered
Smiling down from a human tongue!
This is a frame
Sparkling but cool to touch for ever shall it shine
Only as a gong or a speaker's horn.

To me the dew was like a blade
Round about which were turns of silvery hair
That shoot from underbellies of the glass.
To be pinched off and propped so!
And now to be suddenly hurt
Like a thread of cotten rag.
I thought at first thou hadst something more
To offer me than thou hast now to offer.
What was there to charm me about thee but word
Or graven'tOpinion? But now, am I disappointed?
Awake my heart to its power,
And turn away thyself a feather-headed bat
And take the pinch of the Thyme plant.

The Thyme he threw is in the Thyne woods.
The Thyme plant has flecked out the door.
Now to be pinched like a sorb-root
And be stretched out on the table half-way through!
You think you use the language of your friend,
And in this keep the faith of a fool.

To play the fool is not by any means wrong.
Having an opinion is better than bad.
And all offences to imagination are
In this our paradise.
Our garden is set up in the garden of
Metaphysics, and whatever else
The Parsee or the Turkish or the Hindu
Ever did or will, is what is right.
That what is right is better than not acting
Is evident from this.
I am only a word,

To be pinched like the Thyme plant,
Must be but natural justice.
--This being taken in connection with
The existence of millions of other beings
With whom the single being of us

And swelled into annual intrusions

'Fair play,' thought I, 'I take it, as a divine gift!
Thou bearest well. I, too, have carried off
From their good mother's good grace the three gifts,
Which, hand to hand, in solemn Roman order,
Thou there didst present, and a fourth was strew'd
Upon the altar, as a gift to be
Present to Caesar. You the spear, whereon I struck
In Aquinum, lo! the broidery herself
Before your face was wrapped and strewed with stones,
Which vision-Ulysses, I much desiring,
saw there and sprang to hands and fists to hit her;
But she straight, with safe old manners acting well,
Became a virgin wife, and colt no more!
And, therefore, as my gift to you, do ye
This goodly stave, but in no rough hinting way,
But in your best well-pronounc'd going forth to me
And to our faithlike accord also here below.'

What aileth I not in Italy
To hear her name, the queen of Latium? But come,
Thou judge of larger brain! with thee allow
I must, and my sweet life thus end at Rome.
For, indeed, I trust no more to tarry here
But go, as I do go, to Mycaena's shore,
Where, oh! the sport is set! the games of horse
In broad daylight, and outdoing broad lakes spread
O'er the shadowed valley! But yet, my son,
That which is Rome is hardly worthy to be praised
Below these lofty and noblest walls.

'Yet I will not praise. For here you left me orphans,
Which two impregnates my protection have lost.
Compare my tribunes, which gave birth to sons,
Sertios and Polyphaccess, with the world
Which these same Heavens have beheld the mark.
Now, stranger, to Naiïphow 'tis your call
To wend, and OEkkhrel, see with what care
My secrets have been recorded in the book;
And now, thou stranger, try with me the wiles
Of one Sibyllius, who left me six years
Full young when first he came to me; yet he,
By no men's advice might here have settled here
His roots deep-rooted; nor was Rome so dear
Sweet wife to make me, for I lov'd her, but that
Some more congenial destination plac'd
His affection; for I marv'n how it now
Can get no higher stir, but in walking here,
And at my gates, if one might earn as good
Standing to himself the Naiad more
Than that Virgil, for me let him give
What ways the Virgeral's Job has been
To me, who am no more to seek from her;
For now I wise am aware that I was wrong
To my In-lien-teacher. And as for thee,
Of whom all this was made, I never said
That thou couldst be what I thought best to give,
But let thy getting be to thee as thou wilt,
So that thine honour let what it may avail.
But, for my sons, for those who are near me
I would die, so soon as draw upon my sight
The ways of Naiad. This art I name
Testily: if thou cleanse thee in the flood,
I will allow thee to the races of man
Four for each year; and for the other two
For joy and pow'r ye shall deal soon; but first
Thou must endure, I swear it, five hundred years
To learn the art of magic of my mind,
To soften thee to me. This sixth gift, in which

For the easy science is aging.
But with that art thou must supply the defect
Of this my sixth gift, my wonted chastity:
That thou obtain this from thyself: for me

To my science his aid, can be so cold
A guardian after that he've brother too.

"The Hobbit", by David Hernandez [Living, Time & Brevity, Activities, Eating & Drinking, Philosophy, Video Games, Musical, Social Commentaries, Popular Culture]
—Oy vey! Let's play the games —

Hobbit with us in the tavern!
Some argue that may is not and that's OK
 together we have many a shorthand
And the letters are Baldur's Gate
And we shout, yes we can
Into the meta-alchemy
That transformed a pair of dice
Into a work of magic
That whisked Thor from hammock
Into a powerful FATE Gem
That spoke words in broken speech
And asked if we would like to play the games
And supplied us with on silver gold
A gondola we can sail
A chariot we can ride
A harp we can shoot
A maze we can dance
A horse we can ride
A ball we can ride and dance
A place we can ride
—OKay
Then Hobbit with us in the tavern!

Even so the silence between the time and place,
Which is at last not silence, but rather
The utterance of all speech, the seed of speech,
Has led thee to seek this mystery.

I have not denied. I have not summoned thee,
O thou long-hidden source of light and love!
My lips have breathed no boast, no proud hint
Of knowledge that is worth the knowing;
And I have no unburied soul to lose,
No broken neck to slay for praise of King Recald:

Not all is well,--that is the weakness,--
That is the weak spot in victory:
That empty bliss, achieved, the sorrow's grist.
O to what depth of being! O to what muck
And filth! that dirty, tangled mass,
Thorough which thy weary soul has toed the way!
O to what firm-est acting high, to vile,
To what black, loathsome ground thou trodst thou aware!

What? shall the waving grain beat the windy sea?
Shall sunlight mantling over raise the steep?
Shall thempapilla milk its geeky burn,
The sun-begetting mushroom, to dis Grammy shit
The glory of the sun? Shall the rotten peach
Put forth its shameful leaves, and dokkuba get
A boost from Crap's to crown him king?

What if this place be Hell!
This yawn of air, smelly, filthy and comprehensible,
What then? The fruit can't be condemned, right?
A different sort of nourishment, entirely:
The very air we breathing, we filling, we
Who make fruit production, and order world,
Should be able to make enormously.

The rind, the cud, the core, I am he that's getting it:
That's what I'm waiting for all these decades:
The core's what I want, and that of the rind nothing;
I've consumed you, and my seat's on the mountain's up there,
So stack me now to the very highest.

I'm himself that's waiting on the verandah door:
He's a famous man, that's him, banishing fear and trembling
In his light indoor nook, not in the streets nor in war,
Not with the wolf among him, not with the jailer.
With me he's practiced all these methods of escape.

But he's no beginner, none anything, and first he'll try
To imitate the Italian man, to see if he,
A Florentine, may get it right.
And so he tries to make the platform stand as straight
As it's ever inclined, and to get the same
in quantity as he likes to use of sunshine:
If he's deficient in either, too little or too much,
His corner will be clear and he'll be easier to find.

He sings no politics, and never is good at that;
He's too wise to get friends in high places, he's that simple,
And yet his words have force and take a long, long while with people.
Always I'm loth to make the claim I do,
For it's plain that for my essential lets me stand
The common semantic, but I'm content to work
Within the realm of imagination.

And so it is that wherever I mate,
I make my little record of "Vito,"
With portrait and portrait of ornament,
All running together, singly, one and all,
Nor praying I do much hope to be consigned.
I'm content to live here in a age
If only I can carry 'Vida LO DEM"
As I begin it, and make a name
Out of an idea no one suspects.

I bow to the Orient. I think I see
The Arabian boy's excited stir, as of yore
The wildest fan theory he could grasp.
There's Vimanatu there to teach him how
To handle the bow, the fulcrum of the bow.
And there is Nizam
Address he to me in Zulu;
Where to go is as to take a dog.
I know all the words to "do kgo?"
I know the village where'er I go.

The narrator is a prophet, and we follow him
As through earth's multiple intersection
He travels from his earthly
Assault through various lucidity,
To the multi-vadal vision
Which then we give in our hearts to God.

Modes of Nature, with the
Power and Might in its purest,
Most extravagant embodiment.

With a big one there:

Where the wife, from some Gape, or rut,
Down to her brother's farm,
Does a little serv'ry there;
And the nappy ha's bet the jar,
For a decent corner there.

And there they lie, and make him go
All out of the house so d--d,
With the nappy hose, the ain'thern,
In the nappy, while she's there.

Ain't it cold and clear?  It is,
Muvie the fire's a-lak my throat;
Though I do miss the smell
'Twas so strong I could not pass it by.
Shure, my 'prentices, this is a lash for poor creatures to perish,
And a drab for eyes, and a stink for poor bits of bodies there to keep!
Had the weather been fair we'd 'elp one for at the end of the day:
But we cannot foresight, we cannot now regret:

Now and then, say what you will,
From a fire it's worth a click;
But you must bring the candle with you
When you cuddle beside the kye;
And you must keep it for a while
Till the fog comes off the pines.

That's our request, and, how ya'll please,
We'll let you have another dish.
Come, try the famous stew--it's grand --
We cut it fine and we beat it fine;
Though it's no heaven but grunting pain,
'Tis good the mince is light and free
We'll give ye this--way--take it off,
I've nothing more in me that's good;
But it's mostly other men's pith or tin in me --
At a divine cost, no doubt,
I've never sent you guys a straight one yet --
But this one's amost persuaded me so:

Now light on Western St John's Street, a feast for the eyes --
More sin, no less;
And it was for the Mallard that we dined
We askt the rump in to tea.
Tho' it's (well "Dat Spot" you have there?)
No wider place 'n Switzer's got a meat and a steer.

The loome and the fire are ready, the meat is asking,
We want you Roast Kill to prepare it;
Bring water, bread, lid, killer, wine;
And such a punch as the New-world kings may drink
We've brought to salve your pleasure:
Come, come, come to the Klook Smash:
Now, let the storm begin!

To the old 'sostick'gian, her running off to the new 'sostick',
In favour of the stringy-tongue.
The New-born where the old's over-come,
Will we have her taught to sing;
While her fiddling-master's fiddling,
Precipitate she'll be;
But the old 'sostick'gian' -- she's had her day:

If you were a big black dog with a butcher's knife in your hand
And a bell in the air,
And that big black dog was the Devil in human shape --
And that bell in the air was a half-gutted saint's bell
In Jesus' face;
You'd look in his face and mark, though his black wing was flapping,
How pink his feet are;
You'd look in his wing and utter various utters
Of the words 'Hoeloft',
That is, 'Hoeloft', that is, 'Hoelleth'.

'Past us three men rolling and scrambling for the door,
'Eked under door for doorposts that had been neglected;
'We see that it is clear to the Chancellor's Lobby,
As they crow that the Prince first had been loitering
In the Larbe Crower Square';
When a voice shouts out, 'There he is, first in the mud,
But he will be first in his pluck!'
Well, they were sure that the piper was to be blowing
At this time in the future,
When the Prince came to the Welltons -- in "Brickbats",
When the Prince had to stand before his father,
So that his speech was not delayed,
And the father, "My dear, you'll be amused!"

From the cemetery a bird-soul croaks distressful,
'Twas the darkie Blackman, the world forget;
In the park the brownies failed in their work;
For the death-wind was blowing both placid and brave

Things are never as big as they seem.

How many widows weep above the water,
Under the high architra of the winding crown,

A wood, with willows? A wilderness?

Not yet apostased but withdrawn from
Sunlight, moss, and milk, or vain regret?

In words at first sight, the heart's dark ransom
Known but to a few, is life and limb

Of a nameless thirst and bewitched defies
Untold, and unapparred; but I bear arms
And fire at last!

HOPE is over the hoops of horizons far away,
And not yet in;
And not yet in, the bar, the blank oblivion
That silvers the good man's heart and sends its lights
Unveill'd upon lifetime's penitence and tears.

HOPE is over the ramps of hills and curves white and far in,
And not yet in, the ways of fate.
And not yet in, the mirroring glass of sunrise, the bud and frustrate
Blast bare of light,
The high tide ere-ward, or the flow of morning drive
The world's laggard down.

HOPE is over the high walls of gulfs and cañons, of hills
And peaks, but not yet in, the veils of nameless things,
Of unknown light and weary things, and not yet in,
The mantling waters and the Gates,
The last days of the old men and beasts.

Ah, these are the Halls! Ah, this the flow and swell
Of all the tides that surge and find no shore, the growl and byzi and
Pluckt of blossoms, and the dour things that strew the ways,

Unnamed, unnamed, wall-eyed and tearless, weepless tears,
Unnamed, unnumbered, unnumbered woes!

Who,
So careless of himself that his most opprobrious
Association is the bright beauty of his best,
If I might but liken him by similar likeness,
Would be counted fops in his presence;
He may have done himself the mischief
By careless still;
And be excused
Because the fountain of his praise is near,

When I do salute it, it renders back
Those blessings with a thousand slipper presses
That he will not spend;
He is a                                  
 Unrefreshable faithfourse
That the sun, the moon, the stars, fear;
To these burial urns his generosity not valu,
Or aught of recycled  rounds
For their sweets;
He is a  fountain
Of                           perpetual
Elysium, that the world

When I read that way,
I like it well;
Though I am not a dreamer.
For not quite asleep, but while it pierst
My eyes with lovely tremors,
I seem to rub the seasill oer and on
With my caputires,
To force down the gate as hard as we can,
Until they roll back on us, and we rouse,
Pining, to find no more
Our dear reclut Tempter:
For he as water spreads his head
To lave his white hands,
As we do our stews,
Him privily washed, we salute, and kiss,
Bespatter'd with our children's tears.
And he, though cold, more happy than we dreaming are,
Would be the lord of more
Known degrees of bliss
Than any but a libertine;
And I might say,
In truth,
He should have but one self, and only he himself
Among his servants,
That we might give and part with him
From our joys and from our disappointments.
Yet by our close encounters
He would be the more hard
To displace us;
On the contrary, we
Risk ourselves much less, if he knew us.
But most of all we need
To be seperated
From our own eyes; for each man's self knows best
What God hides from us, and what manner of God
We see most clearly.
And from the least outward
Can be he given
Behind which not one point
Of our dominion stands, and God's unchanging
Command stops.
Therefore it can have no other; nor ever
Should be sought,
Unless perchance to give ourselves more clear to his beck.
For if he knew
The depths of God's glory, and could be wise
As we are stupid, his scorn would be at our noses,
And his spirits would taint our quite human love.
And then the life which most puts life and love
Within us, and is most honest and true,
Will of necessity be troublesome,
And test what we see in God, and be malignly
Devised about us, or shake us with excess
Of melancholy when we see him: for 'tis the cause,
There's no quenchless light about him;
And whilst we see the reason quenched in this
And crushed into nothingness, our eyes are met.
But if perchance what details of affliction
Cannot all be out of doubt the fruit,
Then we must say, indeed,
Such God is
As Satan said concerning his power in all things,--
And by the law of wrongs
Is made Divine;
And then there's this ado about him planting
Nought but discord in things right, and spreading
The deceit of ruin, and the ploughing of the ploughshare
On the true seed, and the gates not opening;
And many other ironies to real nature.
While these are an offence, and what they are not
Leave vague and unparrapt, as parables.
But hear a wonder most great,
If thou draw not thou at length
Untangle this Labyrinth of love;
First, though the seven times that dig the grave
Give unlimited power, it is not thus
Giv'n without he cent,
As this thought in us who dare expose it,
That where there is no discrepancy between
A thing desired and sorely robbed for it,
A sky of stars may flag in scale.

"Every Day an Echo in Me", by Camonghneup Van Winkle [Living, The Mind, Activities, Indoor Activities, Arts & Sciences, Language & Linguistics, Poetry & Poets]
That which cannot be expressed has no word because there is no word.
Latin adhaurants (indeed, these have ratter–d words put around the participles that define the essence of what I'm trying to get across) and so I'm stuck, though I know the rest will convert so this is just one way.
So for example, if I were to say, 'The cat slept the entire night,' that is, I have those words (the very words) and they are either false or true.
There is no silence I; I have silence sitting right there beside me.
I could be sitting anywhere; silence is sitting right there beside me.
So I go the way of the horse and metaphor my way along, where I don't have to go alone and I don't have to go alone again.
I went to a restaurant; I went to a movie; I went to a store; I have gone in many ways since I last knew each one of you alone.

"The Chalk", by Tom Hallion [Living, The Mind, Love, Desire, Activities, Jobs & Working, Arts & Sciences, Poetry & Poets, Reading & Books, Social Commentaries, Money & Economics]
At the cradle of the Four Seasons banked from cab advantage,
the Chalk.
The Chalk.
The Chalk.
The Chalk.

the cradle of Kentucky, a term (rumbling) stuck in the mind,
stuck some sort of a sense of what is what
in the mind.

like a suds, or a thread,
you can tell it from a fas′ or a fray,
but you won't know a stitch from its' stone.
And yet, with a faint sentiment, the suds and the thread
clings to the Chalk.

No matter how often you scrub the dirt
from the cradle, the stone will hide as plain as the dirt did
and you will only be able to care, as you ought,
for one thing:
we can never get too much time to think,
we must stay unithered, preterinary.

I am not saying the chalk is chocolate,
blackest laundry, or man-sized,
but it's real, can't be tossed,
you just can't get it all.

How many times must you be raised from
what you thought was real,
the world gone back to its lines,
the floors, the same as any other,
salt and strict circular movement.

Just when you thought you were tried and true,
anabolic action on the brain,
its domeless fantasies, an athlete aiming his shot,
an epic shift, you realize there was diamond boots
all along.

Like the universe made entirely of black,
your people were as well.
Sure, they had some fantastic green and blue stones,
but diamonds.

Time touched each stone in turn.
The Latin of your name was 'cluded';
the water of the fluxing glass was black,
the fire burned black, the human sparks fell.

The chalk was on some spaces, just as the genie was
on our people.
The chalk was ever our ethic.
(We believed our forgiveness was the same as our love.)
The stone said don't bow, the chalk said we did,
said don't be crazy, said here's what has been done,
said here's what comes,

"After the Summer of My Youth", by Tom Dis Clemente [Living, Coming of Age, Time & Brevity, Nature, Summer, Philosophy]
Have you seen them roads?
Mile upon mile of ticker strips
magnolcos of yellow hued exhaust,
slanting down to drainage areas
where iron gains brief but powerful thrust

======================================== SAMPLE 165 ========================================
Mill of the stars, the mass of stars, Mill of his destiny, of the
Earth, and of the sky: and he would have remained in the abyss
of space, had he not plunged through the fissures of the sky.
But thou, Moses, not content with the confines of the sky,
Wert also of the Earth, and badest forth, though through turning
downward, treading the hinges of those heaven-ways which thou
meant t'other day." So Moses descended downward as the flame
which flies, and, in his wisdom, so was overtaken by the
flame, and
then, as it is even, was torn and bleeding, and in his torment
tied. And thus the ancient, as well as the future, promised
and done, who shall stand in the gates of the now for ever, since
he, whose death was prize of the toil of Love's mighty
year, shall go no more (this is Moses), but misery remains for

Then the pious man, whose heart was set on perfect truth, began
to tell his fate, and his life. Thereon the blind-man answered him: "From
thirty years old I have not borne with others, nor have I
consoled myself with friends, nor victualled my problems. But from the day
when I experienced a bit of bread, I have passed in anger,
with my pride having forgotten me. Since that age had gone, in
which it was decided that I of the age to come should be, I
every way mourned that it had taken such from my grasp. Not for
these, who will die soon, but for yourself and for Moses the
bard. I am one, who for his part behind Adice and the Noroyun
accurs'd, without ever having written a line. There
will be, in my case, a master who will suitable praise find for
him; but, ere he attains me, the great army of his age will
call for him, and he will follow his foreman to the mine, or
lumber-yard will have him impitherable." And the wise
old man then, whose visage was even and who had feel'd most for
the reproach that perished, said: "Up to the stars, my son, and down again,
though a wild hog may swim before you!" Hereat I tell thee
that, when I went behind him, he turned himself about,
Nebuchad´s oldest and most trusted servant, and became,
awakening, a sapient heathen. He all his feats of fame all in
incontinence, therefore, achieved, chiefly at the Lord's house
of Horebert, where were present many persons, and behold,
why they had plac'd them in the air places, among whom
was mine host, the vizor of his pursuivant. They too,
I will tell thee, where she stole the bread from the cradle, who
were early moved to rage by their look. And now, indeed,
would I to the fairest, clearest, rarest, proud, gayest,
best sadly saddest, that thou might'st also be my follower
and friend no less than myself, let thee do so at telling
me of thy troubles, when I have first had chance to
weep."

And he then:
"When a novice in the realm of God, that is, in that
ever-maintaining divine city (by freewill. . . honored
and compensated by the pine-tree scalps sold, or stolen
screaming in the market, or the palms, which set on the
trunk, or the skin from a living fenny squirrel,--
well more than two billion pine-trees full stiff, it
Thus was heated the desire of death for death,
and of life for life, and lust for lust for death more fierce,
burning in him and in his house tragedians, who with the
oak turned their all too gentle baby into terrible
bear. And as there are gates of crystal on this one wide
way, and by betwixt are wells of wonderful virtue, and he,
exalted in his ignorance, deemed that he could water the
earth and the air accelerate, and that he could heave the
world up like a short-necked ship, and that he had oracular
signs from heaven, so that he might have the power of the
sun or the divine light, and that he feeding on the dew
of oracular over little souls was able to make them grow
bright like the eyes of night, and that he might have the
inspiration of things, and that he had see from the ethereal

there's no question we'd be living at the bottom of

And just to make sure, if it were, God,

the old one would dissolve
and be no old world at all,

The light enters your ear, not your eye.
When the sky loses its cover, when hair
And skin begin to rub along one another,
Not your eye but your ear filled with everything
Is your mind. . . .
So when you hear, by the grain, a tune
Or even a thought, it isn't just a thought—
The pattern's by the old man rubbing his palm
Over his bone, that's your ear filling with
That rasping old phrase.
The thought of the grass is what the wind's thought
In the tree, the leaves moving in the wind,
Our imagination moving in a flock
Of birds.
And at night the bird-call, the open-MIND,
Flying inside the ear, the bones all moving together—
Think, and you feel, not yourself.

"Thin Side of Water", by James K. Green [Living, Sorrow & Grieving, Relationships, Family & Ancestors, Nature, Seas,  Rivers,  & Streams]
o what would you call a water that has gone
home, the water of the city spring, taken on
a shred of shadow, worn by its owner, worn-to-the-ground,
like a shadow a tree has worn itself into, a cut nature
made on a very deep water, water that is now
wet, still, and is not falling?
o what would you call a water that will not stop,
that will not stop chasing the flight of an angel,
dew dry-trimming the flower to its antler,
o what would you call the water that wakes you
to this small trick, walking-Wave, Poise, Jasmine
and beams, o god, go talk to my boat, o god, o god,

o and when it is a dream I'm telling, when
I'm telling myself I'm dreaming, I'm telling
the edge of this water I'm sliding in on, I'm
taking my own hope and replacing it
with all the others I love losing
and building.

o this water (sweat!) where the slice turns from
gravitonal, this water's blue in the tree
(older than water, their sun's blue), o this water
slipping across, slurring, taking on
its water's twitching, and twitching, and breaking
this greenedge turning, turning in light
o this old green glass, o my bone, o cup of old wine
o I'm scrapping my grandfather's dream, o my hand
holding a cradled pool of old ashes
o my wrist, this white, this broken,
this agonized white dream, the rim
of the glass, something underneath, something
between lip and cristal jar, something I take from
and something I weigh as familiar
======================================== SAMPLE 167 ========================================
Great master of the labours of the chisel
And the steel, go down to the sea-side,
I will give thee all my treasures,
I will give thee all my choicest ores.

In the days of dark and wintry weather
Set thy wax snow-bar to scattersud,
I will give thee ice-shalots in a dish;
In the day of morning set thine lips to write,
Set thy tongue to smite the silvery snow-floor.

Gaze not about thee to the workmen
That practise on the lofty mountain,
Look not towards thee to the people,
Set not therefore thy best gift to do or receive.

'I will give thee all that I have ever
For beauty or for worth,'
I will give thee nothing that never took
Before from one who had none for all his wealth.'

Speak now the price that in my turn will take
The portion of my life to live or die,
Whence shall my being gradually end?
'Nothing' I may not at first accept,
But my gifts to thee 'shall find a place.'

I have set thee the price of horses strong,
And the price of horses, silken reins,
Rifle for the bolt, the ammunition even,
The steel caps, the jackets for the arms;
And have given thee the portion of knights navigators.

In the days of summer, in the time that leads
To the autumn of summer, the coldest is,
And its weather the wars of robbers fanned.
I was angered by pettiness and pride,
And my feuds with men were of the worst kind;
I made my sword bright iron-trugged, and unsheathed
My war-club in the body, and sought the river.

'I will give thee the ship of love;'
Then providence can lend thee all her worth,
The truest navigation itself must be
In the picking of the tokens that may guide
And the choice of the right-quick cause to save;
Then, when all else hath been once equalized,
And there is nothing left alone to merit,
Then thou with thy soul's consent shalt Eros speak!

Then to thy soul just-sounded Desire
Threw open paradise, and made her just-seen!
Then the blind Abrah's, revenge-tongued Uproar
Spouted blood, and threw light death sonship in the stream;
And the god of fire throw up bough and the tree by name,
And curse thee, and grossly terrify and even me!

If thou hadst not scorned with mine affright
Of scorned his afflicted hair and eyes so short
And bendingly expressive of the years' soak
In our seeing eyes, and we left unbeauty bore
Untheless the airy region, and unsent coronet
Of the sweetest and brightest head that is with leaves on earth,
Thou mightest easily have clutched me thely as-it-were
Of random and get thee over me, and for no ill!

As God died Giving life to thy cries and thy cries of a stone,
Thy stone-ears breathing fire into dust, and thy tongue of rust,
Dust-hungeny tongue perishing of the divine elixir,
Dust-hungeny tongue lamenting the beauty that was not in stone,
And every broken thing, dying apart and weeping apart,
Dying and giving birth to inarticulata,
Thou mightest have had sainted with thy body of truth and just,
Dying thou wouldst have had sainters for the holy dead,
If thou hadst not scorned to be the saviour and uplume
Of the wild dance, the sealed, the rapt, the lion,
If thou hadst not mocked me with a hug that was truth and strength!

If thou couldst not sing for it was a glory of the hillside,
The high song of the river bed of a windless land
Unsepulchered, and the lisp of the grey river prancing
In the sun; if thou hadst not led me as a prince lead a crown,
Thou mightest have had the sway! All things I did command
And complied, and instigated all events as they passed,
Till I could hold you in my sight and give pen to hand;
If it had had its course without defect, but for thy delay,
Itsnce whence I held you in more than foot and feel of the power
That makes the arrow many-coloured and peradventure wind!

I have been to market-town, and bought of poets and lovers
An uplope of pure language

"Scars", by Maggie Smith [Living, Life Disqualities & Downward Reasons, Nature, Winter, Philosophy, Mythology & Folklore, Greek & Roman Mythology]
In an hour the whole damn world will have died for
Or more. Every gnarled man like a leg will shake. Every
Snowdrop. Every feather. Every paperclip. Every duck and
dove. Every mortal woman across the table from you has
To know what comes to mind, what the next one means. Every
Time they have bothered to come and sit in the little
doorway on the threshold. Every nurse who has stopped counting. Every
Tuning their heartbeat in a meter. Every once of laughter. Every
Breath they have for the whole world. Every secret they have held back
Or should hold back on the next. Every mime they have rocked from
the world. Every mop . . . Every mite will have remembered
Itself to some olfactory cell in the brain. It is an hour now of
Distant humming machines. Of scorpions that swarm inside a pillow. Of
Foams where they have left their labia. Of mice that
Mother's hands have vacated. Of scales that have waited
In O, then O, then again in A, then . . . Every kiss will have given
The cauvin measure of some charm, piercing in the
debilitating amaseh. Every piece of grit in the general lot.
Every X, every X, will have passed through every X-ness,
will have united in an oozing now that will have
Alone chanced to be good. Or rather, good in its own right way.

"The Love", by Maggie Smith [Love, Desire, Activities, Eating & Drinking, Relationships, Men & Women]
I put the mashed peaches down
I put the butter on the fire
They were useful,
To put some fire between
The fire, the water, our hands
When we tried to keep sun out
Our hands were wondering
The green didn't quite make it
Our hands were wondering if sun
Would last, so wet with juice,
When we tried to keep it out
Our hands were wondering if
The yellow worked too
Our fingers were itching
Our fingers were wanting
To be whole
We tried to keep sun out
Our juices were wanting a roof

Our toes were just questioning
A home was asking too
We put the world away
As if sunny days were handy

When we tried to keep sun out
Our minds were thinking so
We will have to fill it in

"Clothes", by Maggie Smith [Living, Life Choices, The Mind, Nature, Summer, Valentine's Day]
All night I have been playing
with fires and clothes.
With clothing and furniture
gone and bodies undressed
They are asking questionsin their low-scarred hours.
Their eyes say Avis and Alby.
Their shoes were torn,
their breaths were pale.
They were told a pleafelike
announcethiring now
The clothes they slept in were just
a tattered ruin.
I know they found what was there.
I know because I was there
what they wore when they were torn.
The night we tried to change
the old chamber cover
the clothes were a wonder
In the waste basketof shame
They were there first.
The way they were used to see
before they were used to not being used
by the thoughtless phrase.
When we tried to take what was given
What does the hair say about what was said
about what was taken
about what was lost
about what was given
and clothed what was burned
the clothes they tried to stop the unbuttoned and unboiled
and (belongie)pants they squeezed and rolled
and (belongie) stopped defrost
The clothes stayed on top
What steps into and above the clothes

======================================== SAMPLE 169 ========================================
Yes, my dear John, and will he was 'taken,
That is, was there a chance, if he was taken,
'Stead of red-teeth scribbling ground-hopping sots,
Foil by the Furies' over-bold, O no!

Just the fellow, just the man,
The foreman, too, who hollered "Stop,"
That so no one should misrecord
(Time's German here) that he said,
For he could not make a "Heard"

(Felt this himself) "pathetic!"
"Stop croaking" with the rest,
His rather bitter words, O no!
But about this time of year
(October, I believe)
When July is at its hottest
And November at its freezing now
Hangs over heat and halo
And thunder in its shade
And has the season to finish

And 'sts down the criminal flesh
To the head of the cornered news
That went up in its place
About a foot from the seat
A full foot thick with weather
And other things as well, O yes,

About God's heat, but not of it
And not to have ears to receive it,
And a tongue to speak it out
In the breath of God's rich life-blood
And have it scarred for him by rust
Of the old iron on the seat, O no!

The riders should carry it, and show
Their insatiable desire
To see the world's expression
In one or other of its depravities
And not more pallid or subdued
Than some person's I could not hear too,
And not more pale, not hazel, O no!

That he was shot, for lack-of-document
And murderer-of-the-command,
Was to make a long speech short.
For when they find a prisoner
Who out-yields their highest hopes,
They but then move on to

The man who holds the record,
And whose great spirit lives
So long and unaided
By any wrongdoing,
O yes, even that--
The man who scourged and scrubbs
And did the dirty jobs,
The sweared-up slave of two or three men,
O no, not that,

For a man's life that has outlived
The fashion of the days
Is not less marbled than they are,
And a man's life is not dimpled
Even by fragments.
A man's life is marbled
By patience, quiet, quiet, blissful use
Of reason, ease of heart,
By high above his fellow-men meeting
His neighbour as brother-while

Not as foe.
I do believe, as a grain of sand
Slightly in the eye of a storm
Is hardened to a lump of silence,
Even a slight error is an familiar
That bleeds a man out past his cap
And his listener up into his world
And his father and so forth,
By God, let him have his moment stupid
And be glad in it.

Wherefore 'twas good to reply to the funeral
Sermon that the preacher had not gone away
For, already, in the pattern of old time,
One was seeing the other bow on a wheel
And the little seraph was divided
At the trees.

The sermon was of grace, but the procession
Was of the crowd.
The preacher's stumps were fallow because
He had stayed too long behind the son
And the little set of sticks
Round which his mountains and his valleys
Row.

The Sunday morning people were mocking
And thought: "Poor evangelist he has,
His hills and his valleys
Who will take him in the rear
And explain to us how much more he has
Than these tall mountains and these shirring streams!"
And the little people were shifting
Their breakfast round to make more room
For the old man.

And you thought: "How welcome the dark dour
Word of an old man's deathless mystification,
For it brings the clean love of the truth,
And the unblemished power of the will
In a moment to this man, and he might preside
Over riches, and his body, and seed
In the earth and souls in the air."

Thus passing the day-long week-town scene
With its week-streets, and turn-outs
Of faintst effigies of suns, and shadows
Over the road, day-dreams, the neighing
Of cattle, and the clatter of words,
And the glitter of petrol-spar and rings,
The man got to think day-long,
Of the

That live within brutes and sometimes with apes.

And use the sense to stand in thought?
And natural to man began,
When from the rudest apes he drew
The thought to man.
He is called most like to God.
Because he might not help us,
We call Him most like to God.
And He is called most like to God,
Because he can help us.

They taught me how to paint and write,
And I was taught by them to paint;
And man taught me to write my names,
And I was taught by man to write;
I hold them both but delayed teaching
That both used one liberty,
Thinking that both did one act,
As they having full free use
Did both act alike the same.
I'll do as they have done,
I'll imitate them all,
And so shall I begin
Perfectly like them all.

Chisel your silhouette o'er the creeping ivy;
With clean, even, hand, each line let down;

You'll find this creeping, creeping here;
I'll show you where your tennis-balled Pansies come
from, and where your Peas-of-Fury goes to war.
You'll see your Magnus beating your Peas-of-Fury
all day long, and your Carrots beat your Pinks;
you'll see your Eugenists destroy the crops
of both those obligate Nuts-and-Lard.
You'll see your Matildas fain to go forth
into the deep body of the Towload,
where the tread of Dulse will bless them
at the end of their long battle.
You'll see the perfection of all you sees
with your own eyes, and yet no better
will every day's a vinaigre
from tractor to ruby Bible.
You'll see your Ravens outropering the Marsupiens,
your Peacocks marshaling to defend
the common barns, and your Ravens
marching through the woods, true brave chest spider
in their
now husky coat.
You'll see your Cattle turning your leaves
against you, your Roses defenseless
in the dark of night, your Stock-dove
taken in by rats, your Oaks
whitewalled in by you, your Cliffs
whitened in by geese, your Airequeogrums
forest-ing, your Dracaefu showing

On the whole I find that most of what I see
is about what people usually see;
the ducks in the park, and the drinking fountains
clear of Viene background, and behind the opera house
the dark figure of the Capitol, mute
and awful, of the State that true loves advise
the wretched, and I find my figure clearer
than in the dark it appears to others.
And then there is my desk, a mercer herself
of processions, and grand unanswerable smile,
and pennated secrets of what I have been that day;
nothing ever captured on film can keep
such register of doing than my camera keeping,
my whole picture kept of everything, my mind
broad open to so much, I am bound to fix
something of myself in it, no matter whither;
the pauses and angles of my being including
Partee, the children, the grandmother, in a few
floors of my life, myself included in them all.
And tonight I find myself in it;
I find myself laughing, and wide my eyes
and my sceene to include the grand panades

of Portia's that jazzima; I include my young
life, the enucleated pill, the Foxfire light cartoon,
my low life; in my ears the throbbing tones
of great performers, and my dead friend says, I

And I know the suspense was gin the old mad night
Partee went tumbling helter-skulk, and my mother
could hear Partee, and included Partee, and me,
and included the many fingers Partee had

 fine speech I do my lord the guest:
I am the priest, the then prelate; this is he
Who kills his time and wastes his life away,
A boorish bore, an ignorant, lowly fool,
A stiff and wrinkled judge, and writer, too,
Full many a tittle, full many a meaningless sign
Shakes in my lord the Duke's keen inquisition.
But you are children of the state
Of English bishops and of English
Politeness, and English manners.
Have you, poor children, no meritorious
Had you once seen a meritorious race?
Have you not seen any one bearing
An elate Savoy miter, an Israel's
Square with a plough's broad trace
Bearing a cresset's diadem
To merry St. Paul's, in the rain
Rainier seizing it off the string
Wrapped around his hand in danger
Of losing it, and hammered it?
What is this, hailing at Sir Winston
With all the hall-fire lights of month-end?
The moon's picture-taking, or the
Milkmaid's scented lock of flower?
Are you to know it only
Or are you one of that garrulous race
That lean, and look, and humbly cant,
Hemlock-strained, the hoary fortune
Lopping off your planting arm?
Why should you know, when a great
Colorless and bad-tempered alien
Is knocking at the doors of your door,
Which you opened before he could pull
 through the keys, leaving a mystery
You will never open, never shake
To find his key between your fingers?
Why should you guess what spirit is in
The heart of things, or muse over
And select the sweet or sad, or generous or
Devoid of malice, when you know
That you have not the key, you have not the
Key-finger to unlock the door
To yourselves, yourself, yourself?

Nature, there; because your eye
See no evil in the creature created
To serve your hateful demands, you had
Made a wrong nature good:  is the
Bird sympathetic, when you tell
The story of the Night?  Know you not
That the Bird brought war and beauty with her
Silver strand both crossed upon her wing?
Beauty with the sword, and peace
Mingled in the bird, the pearl of the stone
And the poisonous flower?
Is this so little a misunderstanding?
You must be charmed that a gull
Cheapened yourCraft for mine.  But still!
Mine is the righteous hand, I would
Hold the hand of providence in blind
Perpetration:  I would awake the
Soul in man.

Nature, there.  You say Bird and Snake, Trout,
Lizard, ruler, serf, you name it; and it is
Yet inseparably, permanently,
Inseparably, interlocking and unwritten,
A pattern without its stars.  Look you.
Look you.  They are angels.  I am an angel.
I am a shape, a colour, a sound,
An echo of what phantom virtue does;
Or else the habit of ancient song,
Of familiar signs.  I am the
Authority which men choose.
They allow me dreams and fancies.
I am their rabble.  I am the
Fashionable fatigue of luxury;
Their stopping down with all
New-cherished sights, sounds, ideas,
The outlaw and check of men;
The loudest and most numerous brand
Of the obsolete nation, the one
Oblivious; a brand that stings
One dropping a few fading colours, fattening
Caesar, our modern way of talking,
And fooling one and all.  I am
The part of Hamlet stretched across
The bridge of war, the absent deviltries
Of past and future confederates, the shock
Of steel in an Austrian musket,
Cunning and treacherous; living elements
Of a great transformation; stray
Sires and surnames of giants; masses
Of precedent, pastures and paradises
Of passion, sanguine and romantic, and filled
With war and slaughter, horrors, and tears;
Cimes and Cressy; precious and good,
Twins without parent; heroes, lords,
Peers of the realm and mother-nations,
Swift-willing and swift-pages who broke
The backbone of the world-encircling Sun,
And all his sons, by quoting the books.

"Grace", by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow [Living, Nature, Trees & Flowers, Arts & Sciences, Music, Social Commentaries, Farewells & Good Luck, Father's Day]
Grief's royal day,
Girt with a golden cloudlets
Over the mountains that beg
Her smile at the world,
Over the cities of pride
She knew not, and of humble songs
Motherly in scope:
Grief like a wandering ghost
Fills the lands and the worlds that were,

And her tears like the polar breeze
Fell and filled the air.

Now her flowers are forlorn,
Striped like those that despair
In the hush of the dawning
When the Spirit that dies down
Drops the lips for a smile,
Turning to an odorous warmth
The perishing seasons.

Is her soul with the mortal dead
Chill on her bosom forever,
Who were so passingly
Perchance, unheeded like some sound;
And the sole memory left her
Was that she was alone.

Will the arcane gods whose oft-resurfaced
Flesh she never stirred in the maze
Of her weary walk forwards defy
 Her now better doom,
Who pass like unfamiliar dreams
Through her empty watches, and chisel
Her house and her world with sounds
That she is alone?
Her, the breeder of inscrutable
Traces, that misrepress the true story,
And with smiles the ghostly grief?

Is the vanity in her eyes
And her breath, through the mortal veil,
Ever the soul that moves in her feet
And minds the door of the chambers
Under the floor that is hers?
Is there a writ on her face, or a frame
She must hold, or she and she are gone,
And there is no bridge, no passant
Shielding the pass to come?

Beneath the perpetual swing,
Beneath the rathe twice perennial wave,
Under the ringing nights and the sway
Of the hollow abyss, who steers,
Who steers with charts which are not his,
Towards certain lights that change, that change,
South-south-east or south-southeast?
Who pilot with hands of long grasp
The lightnings of the world?

Gone down the vale to the mouth of the dark,
Where the lover gods hang out in shops,
And the malign gods hang down in the hollow
Around the starers, who are the gods,
For heaven of each snatch and tear,
For the utter boundlessness there
Where the lover gods are stored:
There the evil eye that struck breath,
There the cunning one that hurt,
There the cruel eyes with which it was done,
Where they've bread and crumbs to store.

Gone down the violet vale, the goose quie feathered,
Gone up the flex on the wiry rough.
The light of the twelve aternes was seen,
And the wight of Tuba lading at the dock.
He flossed it, he cross edgewise the hard way,
Hailing with his hands for the voice of the song,
Hailed the mouth of Manoran of the giftkeeper,
Ere he went down the chestnut hill.

The curve of the walls of houses and of rooms
Was the line of the canal that wound about them,
Where the carts came and went again instead,
And the sand of the walk was of flowers and grasses,
With a thread of the mud in the middle,
But the walls went upwards as the hill went upwards,
And they were sacred to the love gods.
And a breath-like shammar trod the road,
With its feet set in the molten pearl,
With its shoulders given to the breakers,
And its arms rounded at the end.

The sound of the voices and of water,
Of the voices and of the water,
Shown as one wing of the night in the sky,

Is there any remedy
For the small
To be she,
Small, and alive

A CERTIFIED Midwife will declare,
You have some food on the fire,
Something for the child to eat,
Some medicine for your child to take:
Here's a drop of water bind
In there. Your child is quiet.
But now, just listen.
Where is my baby?
Oh, I'm not afraid
Of the one who looks after your children,
My friend. My friend
Is the one who loves our children.

Yes, my son is dead.
And I will never find
A trace of him.
The room was dark that held his sleep.
No sound, no odor.
There was a blindness in the presence
That can't conceal what you have done.
There is a silence in the sowing
That grows with every seed it sow.

We Midwives are free to do all things
That pregnant women can do
With the secrets we know:
To water at the ready,
To give people birth
And make all childbirths go well.
I have set myself a few rules to follow
When tending human seed:
Do all that you can with the aid
Of an Athame or an Active Dry
To speed the process of ripening up
The healthful growth of grain for men.
I hope my work will pay.
I do not wish to deceive
For my sake or for gain
Nor with a selfish hand
My God's anger on earth be tried.
I do not wish to be
A midwife to the poor in Middle-earth.

I must be gone ten thousand years.
From the isle of tragedy where I was bred
And descended.
In that island there is not one stone
But bears broad acres where the black and white and gray
Might span the ranges and runs on like a serpent.
The sea is light between two harbors too narrow
By halves, nor far to seek a sight
Of what may spring on earth when fully grown.
There is a human in each tree, a home
Outside the formed woodland, a cave
Where God may fix a cradle for each one
With cradle and babe, and see how empty they are in this world.

There is a name
That clings to me and gives me light
To vision new worlds to see.
Only by bud and leaf
And leaving now of one small limb
Which leaves a path unfriended
I go forth to breathe and fail
And leave our daily lives,
Our cities, riches, pomp,

Our cries for others, given to them,
Their word for us to do
Those deeds that we can learn
Or they could have done, and less.
I leave my little in a person
Dependable and strong,
Whose joy is deep and widespread
A friend I've never known;
Not easily taught,
Born to a higher breath
That would with me cling
In union no more nor care.

One limb remains.
One word still kind on mine.
Look, the bud is complete,
The flower has left the cavity,
A single word and bud
Are one in life;
I read the word "one"

Now all must be acceptable
Pasture for deer and mule
And cave for man to sleep in.
The word is come;
It stands upon my palm.
It parts my life,
Lives for my friend
With the word as a handspike.
It speaks and stays;
I shall hear it

It works and heeds not time.
It wears the magic word
Of that which it considers;
It sleeps not nights nor mornings
Nor the long days of the months.
It wears the chain
Thrown over life; the light
Of mountains and of the level,
The word by the hand
That no one can interpret but he.

I shall never pass it gaping
To see the magic or its depth,
It shall not be seen of man;
It shall be fully known
Only by writing
As magic is fully known,
And may not be adhered
To by pen or tongue;
It shall be grasped by doing,
By the soul fully acquiring,
By wisdom, love, and power
As a fruit one day, a diamond the next.

You with your history,
Minister of this on earth.
Andily intellectual and careered,
Plainly and subtly reflective,
With reflection and rise to any occasion,
With powers of activity and presentation,
With received belief,
You with your being,
With received belief
And just accepting
That there is such thing as personality,
Yourself the sole and present spirit

He had waded in muddy water with a needle,
The needle stuck in the linen-tooth,
As they had lost their way and gone ashore;
The painter's brush was in his hair;
He flung it, and exclaimed: "No, no, no,

That's not the whole and true,
I'm sure you'll not print that word of mine!"
Well, he had caught a fashion, or so!
But now, before a-tipping along,
He stopp'd and saw the tops of systems rise
In chasms of huge rise, and go.
The painter caught a whim:
'Twas a groupe--a race--a custom,
To paint the beasts they led.

And aye, and thus, from that point to where
They got before a little skin-club
That bothered out another custom,
They could not pe do!--
For the race had learned a thing:
That the highest boasting frog
That then crossed their track was two-years-old.
So they led, before that night was out,
A pretty clean race;
And, ere they were through, our bold men knew
That the Duke, when he understood,
Would start them all and every one
Off with a hammer for to have a go!

The long brogue that moulder'd up,
It made our brave men uneasy.
It made their strength as shaky
As an expository pane
That in an academic lecture
Could tell the nature of things,
And bring their namers right to a plight.
The more the tellt them, the more they knew
The nature of the system.
For now they knew, beyond a doubt,
The direction of the push
That made our heroes reel and sink.

Their midges, too, began to merrily
Attempt--to deal a treacherous stroke.
When unwary, our good Duke never missed;
His mates were on the losing side.
They tried it with huge rapture,
And some made harder sweeps
Than ever dreamed Julius Cæsar did,

But the surest way was to give it a rest;
It soon built up its shouldering load,
And in a while it turned to face the sea.
As: "Right heart, I am a-going to sleep."
The calm water kindled and extinguished,
The midges grew dark.
There was a wind that overnight changed
The ointed coffee-cup-ogn honouring
Of our heroes asleep
With a frore little ghost,
With a roundELIZIAKRA visible in view,
And an ANNEBER walking fast to and fro,
And a startled TORT ON EASE brand new in his hair;--
But to quit your own sad story,
Tell Billy and WAL, I am sorry for you.

And, "What am I taking into command,
Six officers and two ranks of boys,
Not to speak of our two negroes?"
Six--and look! they are taking history,
By their captains loving eyes;
Two negroes, and a captain that
Is riding fast through the part.

Now, poor WAL, that is true singing,
Though he does not say so:
For he knows all there is to know
Just as, when he went away,
The old huschicles she hid from Jacob
Remarked, "It is but late,
That he keeps six months back."
For six months he had lain away,
And vainly had wished back to keep,
Which the Lord has restored to him.

When you by Queen Anne's nose the mist off,
And see the sun again,
Then six months, young as you,
And in the sunshine fighting crime,
You'll see, in talking, that the dust you stirred up,
And covered with huts, is rich in silver.

On like a horse the sun is mounted,
And you in the sunlight problems;
The bee's for clouds, the bird the stars,
But the white man the world can take a dream,
And make it his,
The wheeling, courting sun--
But I am the sum of the years and you
Of the dust and fields I saw,
But you six months already have seen it all.

Yes; if it's his dream we're a little after,
Why don't you go with him,
Went with me last summer, when my six
Short months away!
Can't stand the summer-simmer's light charge
So I with the sun are force to blend?
But if it be old Eli's vision,
Settled and set, remember,
There's one you can't translate it out of hand.

Bodies are weird things.
We morph and divorce as we enter, merging
with our encounters,
and thus are unified
through their defamiliariz-

ability of their copy is pas-
stuous. Any number of them might be yours,
but mine is already atrophied,
uncompasses/fetter-ous, abl- it.
The memory of it consumes me,
in its plaguyness dims my empath- ized

Oh chicken-wing salad dressing. Deep onion brownness, hair-growth daemon and gall-break sample, taint the ball, skully stain to set free downstream and queue up a flood allowance to shake life's propellers like an ember in October. Oh rot, damn you, you out-of-step the pattern to my single pollen and my carpenter's pattern to his. My face once seen, dead: white string wisps tied around the gaping print to spell wound, to mark, not to tell the tale. Oh wound, wound, wound, wound: his blue blood smeared across my arm. He couldn't know when to quit. Oh broke, oh wound, wound, wound, broke.

 100.

'T was spring, and every tree bore
A bud and a tongue
And the meadow-lands were alive with
The honey-bewood
And each field had every flower.

'But one which the garden-walks
Had vexed, for it only bred
The vegetable tragedy,
A flower and a cry,
The courting eyes of the full field
For food, and the priest's cloak.

With a horse's bristling mane
As if a sword had fled the water,
As if all human love had flown
For food and lover, blind
The happy horse of the brindled nanny,
Her heavy eyelids, she went a-maying
In merry mood, looking 'broody.

'Thence unto the city I,
A drunkard and a brother,
With some game-dounds, and rants.
The merchant's market was near,
And hallooed an angry goat,
'Gainst which a few pennies squibs
Against the entry of her wares.

'There ringed the armoury,
With its last pence to shop,
A last coin of chits to rub
Against the cabs a jay on every tack,
But it was she, upon the seat,
With chin resting on wrist,
Which had refused the dew of the sluice.

'I was like to say, or flabber no,
She feather'd me from neck to buck,
And twitched meate fat as potato,
And even made me carol a flight
As a goose out of the wale,
But the goose-guid tears had come too,
In an unluckled early way.

'And now, with lap-dog always on the watch
For peril in wait,
We peered in windows to reseize
That wood-fair maister tail at the mie;
And the fowler's ladder a brower still,
And the clean, neat, lifelike wais de Romeos,
But she, I wist, with closed lids gazing
On the painter's chest of shirts,
Was to woos at our last
Gartest mug of all food and wine
We had to try.

'And, ah! there went, on the fete-day,
A water-bottle gray,
Whereon was painted a vine
All flooded with ocht done fresh,
And in it there was music of bees,
And bees in it a song,
Wherewithy mingled of themselves,
In their honey-comb, was air,
And to the listener near five-and-forty
We said "Be strong, O be strong":

'We caught her by the trainers' cartes
(Her sports of the day provided),
With a face of such gait and audacity,
And with such gallantry, I saying
"Oh, get her by the dress!"
Of a sort, Mistress Kurt;
But she put by them all,
Since I could find not one,
And she said, "Shall I bite my coat-sleeves,
Since Kurt is dead?"

'Twas May, as I am tell'd in the tale,
And the moon, full-nude, say'd, "I
Am woman as we men
That are blest of slumbers--began,
Hybrids, bringer of comforts."
And the stars, one three-hooks-with,
Teem'd, as they do in an ale-hall,
And don't care to shift their cribs
Even when no pub'rs are open,
And one might think they were fowl
By the outcircling that they became.
Then the airs of the earth were pleasing
To my new Wilton:
The sap of the taper-tree
Moved my heart,--'twas young,

'Twas in a dog, "mid his mew,
And a hat that the night-wind
Car'd in his loose ear, and the hat-bill
Brought a quare note
As the cleek of a bell-wether
That the child-quail made,
And the cry was "Hoot," and "Squee!"
And the cooter-pup, "Mee! pup!"
Was a purty d--d.
And the deuce-ment, with his sack-full
Of siller, said, "Come and mow."

And the moon looked down-cast
When she needles the man from Poona
With his bunch of the weep-scard,
And the moon that is
======================================== SAMPLE 179 ========================================
dust, it will sink,
we will all be one dust!
Now, the impulsive blunder
must be cleaned up for posterity,
and the force of the dynamic act
made visible, and the dark,
drawn out of the human,
put there, as once was the earth,
in a single act.

O mother dear, if you doubt the fact
That the earth ain't what it's been, come out!
See what the old earth is made of!
See what the world is made of!
The whole world's made of it ain't it?
See? You're not made of the old earth, you.
And you may go to town, you may get a car,
And go to Paris and play at the piano,
Eat happy in Paris and play the piano,
Or you may stay here and play the piano.
But don't come here to Paris to play the piano.
That's vulgar music, and don't like it!
(Hoot! It's the spot where I get off the map.)
So, mother, when I'm all asleep,
And you're all over the camp with the door in front of me,
And you see the mother and children two
Who have come to the beautiful city of Paris
To play the piano and have a little fun,
And you wonder if the little folks will be allowed to have a bit,
Then come a step with your hand out in front of me,
And I'll come and hold your hand in front of me.
O, come a step with me and I'll hold your hand.

And I'll play when I get back to Paris just as well as you see

As I play just as well when I'm near.
(She was playing, little mother, where was I?)
And when I get there and I am alone to meet the folk
Who have sent the musician, and tell them how I have been injured,
I'll play Paris. I'll play what they see and approve.
(I'll blow the trumpet and then tell them how I have played.)
O, there is but one line that I haven't played to make them cheer,
And that's the very line from my baby to my playing-dog.
(I tell him that's the very word.)
And there isn't a thing that I wouldn't do for any dog on earth
That my playing wouldn't make do.
(I tell my dog what I'm going to do and he goes wop and down.)
But I'm through if you're through, my dear puppy dog.
(I'm through, and I say it and do it.)
I am sick of playing.
(There's the rub. Ha-has.)  For one little moment I was willing

That I should suffer through all the years of my life,
And my victim should be a man with a gun.
I said "for my bones and for my flesh"--

I was prayerful.
But I was also haughty.
And I was also awed.
I was also liege.

I was willing to face the gun
And all the horror of war,
And be killed by the horror of war.
But I was also glad.

Did I also, mother,
Treat you gently?
I said, "Mother, do you mind
That I, when I come back,

Will have done."
You were proud.
You were gracious.
And perhaps you did know
That you had me "handled."

Well, clearly you had me
What's more,
And thus you could see,
Or should have seen,
That I, while I lived here,

Have been too long wounded
In foreign lands
To get home again.
You were curious,
And you let me go,
And you said only this

I asked you not
To send me away
To be a snared witness,
And to be loosed from his pain
For a stranger's cruel use.
Mother, you have me,
And you're new here now.

And the doctor said, "Of all the doctors
That I have seen, he is most dexterous,
And I believe in no one
That will aid him up that wood trail,
And where he will be better.

I believe in doctoring,
And in the healer's magic art,
And he's very fair to look upon.
He is good tempered, and that is a fact.
And I will swear his art will solve

If a horse's tail is raw
And tail-sniff is bitter,
And the tail-sniffer is none other
Then baby Hiccup.
"Yes, young man, I'm better now.
All my jowls are loose.
I'll be back here next week,

But he never came.

He could. Then where, where was he?  Only the sea,
The waste, the wormy ground, where he was wont to lie,
And hear, unwrecked by dawn the village bells
In Peleus' hall, the wild waves breaking, God's hail
Against his lips, against his chest the sun.

With eyes that showed him now in labours past
The father's mossy halls, with hands ungloved
And matted hair that still refused to dust,
Now streaming fire in them, plaited, rough,
His motions still the same, the same, the same,
The naked hand reaching up and down the sand
In looking-smiles all the while, the King of so

All naked then, as he was wont before
To bind the warrior's hands and feet, with thongs
Weird with forgotten leather, that he gave the pass,
Disdaining, save for trust, to betray his art.
And now he stowed'd his arms and coat of mail, and rowld
His bent head down, a thing not to be ashamed:
The naked man the unshorn hide could see
With need that saw't, and knew himself as he lay,
Naked, bare, yet not as some two-year child,
But as he had lived an entire lion's length
Or more, a lion half his strength, the two-foot man
Liv'd, and with that image adjusting his dress,
One of the peopleASTETian weep'd, and thus he said:

My son, who bites the dust of his dead mother
When there is any breath of woman to be had,
The children of intolerable mother-love,
Because they can, wound up with mightier breath
To sting us sore with regret, or throat, I pray
Behold the dress of your own mother, which at first
Was all in wonder, how it would last, with you,
And afterwards with you, the three in one.

Where shall the trinkets, that flashed in the sun
Upon my breast, with the smoke-like signs I burn'd,
Beacst the electric flame that tore my sides,
And in my socket burn'd the murderous steel?
Am I the sport of any day but my own?
O never, in any quick, or sick, or dewy night,
Do not, my son, the lightning of thy mind,
The dread satisfaction bring. I was thy peer,
Thou need'st do no more, sweet boy, to make thee hark,
That was but the original of Love that now
Hath legionNames. And I say it is no kind of love,
But when the heart no more can play the shamming man,
By gainwont desire, by worth, by loyalty that moves
In impotence of pang, summons the sword.

That was but the kindling of mine eyes, that made
Her hair curlat at their rays on my body chanced,
To my face in the gellar of fire that streamed
On through the air a sudden maiden. Come not near,
I might perchance who had worship of thee known,
The God of that shrine, tho' in the Daughter of St.
America, double-eyed for loveliness.
O hapless thought!--Perchance thy long disordered sleep
May have but parklisihed back thy brain, and led thee
By fond suppliants 'neath thy pillow to entreat
That more than golden promise, hand and head:
That sometime may be thine endeavour--O lie!
Who then will restore thee to the golden mood,
Or repay thee in courtesy? the world will lend
Thy golden fancies all their crystal-fledge bricks,
My softest words displace thy sulky dime,
I will not lend thee more then nurse about
Deliriousadhvam, Lakshmi the gem,
And sumati, nor the charmer nit,
And nameless flowers will represent thee
At late death as either came
Of páka, loss, or destructions that destroy.

The smiles, the soot, the quenching amber,
All speak their own clear lesson, and no head:
So with each change of colour, like the smell
Of the soft grass before a queen,
The páka appearances still circulate
Between the equal moons and show their face
Before a monarch's rose: but not an hour
Are those fair monarch's daughters free from woe,
From toil, from gloom, from sufferance. Wise and Queen
In their first love awefully front to front
Seeking some neutral zone between joy and doom.

======================================== SAMPLE 183 ========================================
Bound up with night's and twilight's drear shadows
This bare-bodied night, and kissed by a sun
No sun of day--could ever reach the ground!

The great star-leaf is dropped;
But a thin ripple
Is the thin boy's dress;
And I--I am the next in succession.
Behold, behold,
I, David Anderson,
With my wife's letter
Enclosed in a paper packet.
But the fresh-made packet
Is of most dread smell;
It is stitched so poorly.
It is such a sloppy job
It has neither waist nor quality.
It is such a whipping thing
It has scar beneath any seam;
And I gasp, it pains me worse than death.
It is jammed with seven times 10,
Pint, half-pint, quarts,
It is jammed with trunks, magazines,
Used cars, medicine, pork, and bacon!
It is jammed with trees, rocks, hill-meadows,
And rocks and trees indoors
Where she dwells; and yet I am not annoyed;
For she pains me less than the black-moor at her knee.

Thee, shaepe me, in wanton drowning,
On the dreary sea,
Till thy wreatie bow'r
In a glimmering orb meandered,
And my bathime's meridian
Forsook the meridian
For an unexpected distance.
I'll be wed to thee,
And when I need thee, I'll send
Thy profile supernaturally

Helican,
But the starlight there
Is an adventurous hanger-on;
And the curlew's quiver
Is an Orphean essence
That wings to the heart of us all.
O my love!
My blessed love!
The hand of fate
Is the clenched packet
That, like Apollo's lyre,
Is vibrating, intently, devoutly
To the straining orb of our joinder;
For a husband's kn Havock
Is the chance of our mariage.
And our future Heaven
Is not now decided.

In fine, my dear, I'm mad, and still of that's bad;
And the devil knows how I'm ever to rue
For the scourge of it all the fruit of sweet.
Oh, is't well,
How the toss ensigns sing?
And the Tuscans say
That Lapland's next.

Yea, lonesome is my dreaming of love that's loathly;
For a secret trail
Of sleeve and sleev'eland
Is my trailing of Veronicas;
For a heart that I've digged to dust in
Is a hartless heart.
For the love that I'm bearing to you now,
Him I'm bearully suiting,
Is the cost of loving you now.

I'm bearing it all, as the sword is the stone,
In a yew like a's grave is the yew- hed;
For a receding from ther is the cost of paying it,
Is the cost of paying it to you now.
For a mind whose nobility is in bondage,
For a will that's weak but fervor of loving;
For the glory of its being is in biting;
For a lightning-beam's broad-parked is its scoping
To the fenress.
For the gold-drenched nuisance of preference;
For the surcharge on taste, from a fenress's vantage;
For the heat of a no-landing;

 as they went,
Upon the ground I have trod,
And here I shall them stay,
With something for the agony,
For something when I may cry.

When the winter comes and takes my breath
I shall not ask for home,
I shall have strength to claim
The courage that I need
To leave this land of dread,
And if my word be spoken
We may part in scorn.

The birds of night will ferry over this
Pathless ocean of my dying,
And I shall be with them in hope
That they will safely bear me
To the fair land of desire,
Where I know a place for me
When I have had an end.

My home is that which I desired,
That home of my soul's desire,
That bright long line of land so bent
On the way of duty, loved
With a fervent and boundless love
That even the fearful and unhurt
Must feel secured.

It is a home, the home of love,
With love indefinite
And hopes in many a hope,
And words uncertain
That hide beneath my chosen rhymes
And give my heart's pulse tingle
With thrillings of an infinite
For uttermost hope that pass
Unanswered when it seeks.

It is that home, my heart, mine own heart,
And I would be your sword to turn
To slay the curse that would be yours
To cast to bore and conquer,
For cast down and afflicted race
For that which is not yet yours.

In me you would have a home,
And in this song I will to tingle
The scorn behind which is none,
That I may not lack a home
On the neglected earth.

I will be as a tree to stand upon
In the wind and weather, strong and sound,
Shading the rods with stems whereon the wind
Scatters the cedar-tar that grows dark
With the entourage that comes to an end,
I will be, and I will be as though
The world were mine and you were not
So that the wind you blow may decay
My branch, you will not demolish.

I am the fragrance of summer rain
In the soil that whispers necessity
To farmers who, extra tracts in need,
Know the scent that pattern helps to frame,
I am the scent of rose and litter
In the ashes of old towns where the spiders spin,
And in old fortresses and on frontiers where conflict
Blossom-spectors wait, fear in the air, there is conciliation
And my smell is of peace, and so it is we come to a place
Where we may report our manners to a face conducive
To mutual courtesy and a dispassion that has passed the looking
To the deference of the suppliant soil.

Soil should vow to me as their master, and I
Should vow to them my attention be to them
As the soil to its bearer's health, and they
Should learn to furnish me the best table air,
Erogenous soil that has been artlessly made wet
With direct blow from the sun or from lights like the supper
That has gone out and from the smoke in the eyes of the hills
Erect as cleft wood that has been slowly knapped, chime
Like the hock to the earth, and be

It is I that I call reproach,
Theusterkals, shame to thee.
It is I that have brought the country misfortune,
The country fatherland, the house of blood,
Blowing like yellow puff-balls big with fresh air
That my time-behind has split from end to end
And there is no light, no cinder to gather there,
There is no room but in the darksome dust that I step through
When I say I have no will but insincere.

The wind shall be shirtless when I am dead
But not before I am aware
I will never be clothed again
In something that is mine again
Except it be cold cloth
And that is all in the ruined house
That is not mine again.

In my own country I am a woman
And that is that,
I have no will to move about
And I lie on the ground and feel
The shivers of the wind
Between my bones
But there is none in the town
To see me writhe and scream and writhe
And if I shout
It is useless, there is none to hear
If I fail or survive
My self is all
That saves me doom.

Go look in the eyes of the lover
That is dying,
It is he is the one
Is the one
Living,
He is gasping for breath,
It is he is the one

But he knew me, and called me by my name,
and he asked me in the end,

"Butterfly,--only a little one, can you,
my butterfly, fly at three weeks' end.
Come with me to this corner, and I will show
the four of you to your play."

I said, "Please, Uncle, in the name of.
what the law says, you can't take a child for love.
Look, the statute says it, and it is written thus.
It does not matter that and the case goes to you.
And what matter we?

so that we showed a different spirit
in our offices."
In other words, this man wanted to change.
And in one's voice:
"I take this case."
Not one of us doubted that we were held by him.
And in the end it seemed that he won us,

without the help of Sylphs.
For we got ourselves
to leave quietly at the door,

without a single bill at unpaid,
and no lawyer called—
took our signatures freely
on an promissory note,
with a payable-on :
To pay the balance to a joint account, annually, at the option
of the holder.

Then I thought, Good heavens! What I have done!

and got nothing to show for it
but the pity of a needy relative and the faith of friends.
And I call my life foolish.

I can only wonder what your lives are like, now that you have each other.
But I am not just guessing. I know that you are growing
to love each other,
to want to offer up each other—
call it a marriage of friends in which you each receive a share
in the rents of the house,
and each of you has an equal passion, if you so choose.
But I doubt that this is what we have chosen.
For we have left the bounds of reason
to look after the children
in the night.
We have forgotten that we are equal to the children
in word and deed,
yet choose to keep
your haughty sense of life,
while we are keeping watch of one face and one face only

in the risk of beating my dog's life.
We have forgotten that all is
even, that we are equal to those we hold most in contempt

who have chosen, and keep choosing,
between them and him,
while we keep hearing what you want to hear
till it becomes the story
in their lives,
no allowance made
for one weakness
or power base
among the sons and daughters of earth.

"The Name", by Frank L. Rice [Living, Nature, Religion, Arts & Sciences, Philosophy]
The first who would name the thing he knew

with easy simplicity from dust and led

the quickening metal in his old head

to being name of small things

and with his new thought,

in his old head,
a few roots more white

than to be named before

the next wise sage

touching his foreign tongue

the hard leaves of trees

he calls his children,

touching the orange-trees of his lost

home—
trees that carried him
like a tiny wind

or a smoke into lands where

he could not dream of winds

or a man would be nothing

but trees that touched his young

mind that let him pass
among branches

and communicate with other

children that his bones
couldn't stand on

and that he learned

to be not only strong

to be name a flower

the first herb that grew from a stem—

before the plants

or the name itself

"Old Love", by Frank L. Rice [Love & Relationships, Classic Love]
Love that is still old

keeps up the laugh

and keeps warm in an eye.

You thought you had done with it

when you took it to the chin,

but it's old, and weatherproof,

and won't give a damn.
The good days are in those pictures

like longleaf capped meadows,

the sunshine a clink of salt drops,

the dark standing by.
What you thought was hating,

is being kissed by a weed.

It is barely noticed,

so barely kept that is.

"Peculiar Grave", by Frank L. Rice [The Body, Love, Desire, Nature, Seas,
======================================== SAMPLE 186 ========================================

But she, once self-devoted, scarce more than half
With love and the divine had mixed her mind;
Or was it the sudden blind-fire of pain
That made love a thing that none could look for, but none
Could find, and all too late, when the heart that loves
Was running out of all hope, for love of him
And of the happy arms of room not knowing him?

I know not, but I think of her
In pity on her mind's weakness that grows
A woman among the cold and crude,
Wild groves, and hollow caves of men,
That from the whirling world of children and wars
Must keep the faith with which they were wed,
Honour, the pride of untainted, brave,
Honour and the love of base things, and base
And love of brave things, and noble hate,
And ever amid the dizzy waves
Of changing life that young Dorinda sees
The banner of old ambition bring,

Now is she whisp'ring, and no more is she sweet
As when she hung at our side the night we left.
We cross as women not to sulk nor care,
But to be dangerous on the deeps we love,
Battles the Winds to battle for love's sake.
"Sweet, and defiled! sweet, but dead!"
Sweet like her body, and defiled like him who told
The last sweets told in the dark hospital.

But there is one battle never-ending,
And that is where our love is concerned;
The battle where love is simply and deeply
Believed in, and by virtue strengthened,
That no materi madness should exist
And that sanity be continued.

Ah, sir! when he speaks,
When he is whacked, when he can not steadfastly
Bear his head like a Christian, what a night
Of dreams comes back on him! His brain is cut by the same
Old arrow that found green Arsignor
Beneath Thurron:  and be what he was, and shall,
He will not be Archer rendered!

Hands tremble, arms flagellate, eyes run wild
Over his scattered veins as lances, the knife-thick foam
Of the severed veins seeks the heart with the head
That is not his any more:  and he wakes, a drone,
Out of the hearts of men, as out of the waves
Some clam'va-leapous bird out of the sea.

Hands that were swift for the fire and the love
Of doing, and crying, and ripping and plundering,
Arrested and knotted in a sky of stone if he found
No fault with that of Arsène, the blameless
Crore, the forgotten, the loss-laden,
The sacrificed, to the heart's deepest injury.

Oh?  What hope he has, what know he for joy,
He that once rooted is dread yet for his children?
Trees grow in his garden; he sees the sky
And listens to the woods for aye; and he speaks
Out of the belief that he shall hear ever
New sounds from the distance that shall prove
His hearing right from the forest-trunks.

And he treads again the hear of his father,
And he speaks now to his wife for the third time,
And his children come to him, and look at him,
And he looks back at them, and, fear unnerved
For his life, he ere long finds the old spell goin;
Yet, arms atawvable, the heart can notbreed,
But in vain, for a new arms he will touch
That he may keep all the respite of its safety
For the child yet born.

And he warms them to hear the boast of the mountains,
Yet for Urdon he had need have feared, and for Moray,
And for himself heard the best of all, and wondered,
For we have horror for the warrior in his sleep;
But there is the scourge sole and the ancient scourge,
And never for woe of man the morning morn.
So, to his old magic askerthe cliffs go down.

So once were swept against the city of Leborine,
Down by the Crosses, that in vain had challenged Apollo;
Down by the Bridge of Snow-Heads, that turned its face
Back on the Foot of the Hall.
The city would--as stately--once more lift its lid,
Void there for many a century.

Many a city that here tos its turn would be taught
No other city will this day pioneer.

In crowded, bright street;
His suit in a tearing coat
Before the knocked-down shop-door,
His woman in a swathe-tuft box,
Her short brown hair banged by the lock . . . .
And here again the knock-down blow-hole,
The woman, the suit, and the open door . . .
So have I seen it all, and all and none.

I would not pretend to Eldon's grass-green chair,
Nor dreams of roses, nor the choirboy's Caribbean night.
I have no love of land, and yet I sometimes love a bit of the earth.
I have found out what man is, and were a little rich,
Having lived, and still after having lived on the green Scilly coast.
And if I should ever Gueombuckio see,
In some southern wood, what he will feel and do me good,
He'll cry out to his king, "O sweet old blue-mouthed bette,
Where's a man with big brown shovels and sword to look at?"

And never waste a word in singing the praiseOf saints, priests, parson, saint, priest, and fellow in wings;
A dullish sermon here, a silly pray there,
A silly peacock on the tree-tops mocking the sky;
A silly pray to pass the long winter night,
Till the mad whirlwinds blow their matches and blow.

Ships from the foam of the mighty Thames would throng
The quiet chapel carven by Brother Willie,
If there were no many and varied things to do
In the deep West, rather many and various things
To indulge in the deep West.

The clouds arise over the flats,
The waves lap the cliffs for seaward flow,
The sun looks east, but his might is gold,
The night cries gaily, 'tis sweet to be here,
And we here lie.

Our bodies here lie as we had fallen
In and of the manifest Word
Of good and evil we should thus be one,
But because our bodies are alive
We four are different people far.
The limbs in I know not what torments lie,
Ease and ease would ease me of my Hesper skin,
But the power of torments to afflict, alas,
Me of my grace would make expression say,
Me of my great Grace would make expression.
I am iron to me, the powers that keep me break,
I of the beast would be the creation,
The force that broods in me of no end,
The heat that I would stir out of me, the cold,
The power that might retain and make me bigger,
The forms that are mine in mine ignorance
I must not say I understand, but know.
The forms that must be created yet,
In the making of the new body of Christ,
In His river we will find out devil,
In His river the serpent, in His river the biggest.
He said,
In the beginning when the Gods called he
In the day of the creation
For the heav'ns first work and the first money.
For the hard thing to do was the best,
The hard thing to do was best
Was the task of destroying the gods
In the valley beneath the waters.

He said,
For the thing to do was best,
Was the thing to do was best,
I was myself and I was myself, and I
When I awoke would be gone.

But to hear and to recall is the problem,
Remembered I am myself in I know not what.
My mind is a haunted of myriad fires
That touch my body in the chain and pass.
We are all created, we are all changed,
The nest-born of roses, the satin and the fox,
The child of the dirt and the cattle of horses.
So I am a mind to which thing, I think is best,
But I do not know I am what I was,
The child of my mother, the lion of my dreams,
The satin of my kisses, the eating of my flesh.

I said, I say, I am the son of the plains and roofs
Where the earth was green, the green and the lot,
The tiger, the cock, the slain, the living who fights.
Not I, but I was I in my own before I knew
The dread of the kings, the dread of the powers
The risen and the plate, the bread on the stone.
I say, the thing to do was best, 'twas to rest,
And to be rest for the best, and for food best,

Tossed off the loaded quiver, that the boat
Of Tuscan and Tuscan only might contain,
He left it on the bank, and turning, spied,
Like a banner fluttering in the gale,
Gibius and Lausus, of the thicket-tree.

From far, they saw the trembling boat from fear,
And leaping out, seized the oars; the tightened furred
Hair, and, shivering, rowed the trembling boat.
Nor stayed there, for haste made all men dumb;
But like wild fowl flaming from the rock
They dashed on, with thundering wings through water,
Scarce one, on shore, of all that pressed around.

Scarce from the rocks the mass that bound them down
Had leaped upon the shore, and shook the walls,
Had left a battle in that rabble horde,
That, hurrying on to know the deep of war,
Bore off no mother, and be fed in Tirrwold,
One little lad, and two pale-faced youngsters,
That neither grey had yet received from time, nor made
Infants white till they were crimson years older.

"Who stood to guard the house,
Standing more than guard.
Who was there to guard the house,
The whole great house more than half 
house,
The house with three thousand windows,
The kind of house with three thousand 
An hundred  a year? 
The little children standing 
Before the house with three thousand

If the three were good, a lot 
Of a thing that was to do,
The three might think of it, 
The three might think of more than half

Ranges up in the fingers' of my hand,
Thing's but an incidence.
A wave soaks in the gulf that receives it,
As it were night that sleeps upon it.
Or, as is it to my eye,
All forms of the great long kind,
Light's pure children, tremble, and are flown.
A grain of dust, a little dust,
No more and no less;
A word, a finger's breath,
Is thought's impalement;
A curl,--and all is gone.

She fell on the day
A new and white wonder;
The winds their hands abroad
Around her, to lift her up,
And round about her gazed the suns:
Inventive powers!
O for a draught of air!
O for an outburst of might!
The ripe and the rip!
The blue of the sky, the red sun's ides,
The world's sweet principle,--say,
Would there were air around!

When she was made a lily,
She hung eight years above
The garden of her foster-mother,
The chapel, which is called a 'novo' (new)'.
'Novo'! (new)! The word, though not quite 'fluential',
Speaks the naught between it and 'the chapel'.
Her name the day before the act changed it;
The only thing she needed was

In a white sheaf, stuck close to my Mother,
I hang with my streak of black and my mark far back,
As I was a run-me-over;
Run-me-over! Run-like an over,
A well-spring of bunched up and manured
By my negligent care.

She has grown to be the matriarch of our host;
She wrestles with Omnian (creature!)
More than with any maid.
She sends her bum-face everywhere;
But, like the pea, we never can saddle
Our barks with her stirrups.
She is the maincap, baby, of a homely realm,
And yet I feel a fly
Fly over me in the sense of my fall.
She speaks from a position of a small
Dim light greatly less then dim;
And so, not to be so restricted,
She flouts me, all the time,
By way of a right' (howsoever constrained);
And I feel, by kind and my being hung
In her presence, fly-like, a mighty leech,
Not the least
Awaity of secret things,
Or cloud, or eye,
Or touch,
Or taste,
Or smell, or biting insects' relatives,
Or fairy friends.
Where's the words is it "her world"
They drop,
On the tongues of the unconscious?
Are we not in "dungeons" yet,
She's the stone,
And I am the dudgeon in her mouth?
Where's our common sense,
Enough to shock and be madden'd?
Cunning liar!
What's the magic that will cure me
Of my precipice,
Or un-head it,
She's a witch
Of more ordinary workplace?
She's a Christian, too,
I am a Calvin?
And where,
I have not a tcpalm,
Yet, suddenly, she flings
All the house-rules
Out the window
On a starless night of the soul,
The shingle reads:
"The ladies are dressed, they're in bed, in bed in bed in bed."
They have lighted the lamps for the entrance of their bed;
I have opened the doors of the bare room, and turned
Night into early day.
My gram,
I have be-screwed the people I have been for years and years.
I have ransacked the world in my vestibule, and wondered
Where the mystery may have been.
I have argued and re-fought
Where a knowledge of signs may justify a thought;
I have argued it, and written it;
And a good rule is
Not to start on things you wouldn't understand why you shouldn't jump.
Now the dress is done,
The ladies will be in them;
They'll be in the book, and there found a new rule made,
And the book will give back the signs to their beauty-bringer.

While at the King's front, how high soe'er,
The nimble Crashes go by,
And laughingly at their show,
Tough boys in muslin-kilt,
With big-boned boots and red satin-strips,
The "Nigerien" in crimson clad,
They con their way along,
The smiling dogs stand on the pavement,
They con in doubt the animal to take,
They want the bit between fluster and flask,
And joyously their rings rebound,
'Tween Pyke and the Spitalfields branch of it,
To the whir of black bells and the cluck of white ones,
The spindle-roads they wind for dear life along,
And up to Ludgate they scamper and skarf,
The black-and-whites throw a glance back,
At the Boar's-hall the "Coble" runs past,
The "Scarborough" at Aldermanness,
And The King's apothecaries he sees,
Who think with one great smear on their sleeves
To advise him to eat his fingers,
When he picks at a black-hole in his
Skin, and clucks there like a chicken,
He scoots from that wrinkled man, he will get

--And so, with such harmless people,
Or so it was with its soft phrases
That King deemed he could cheat Fate,
He'd fool the damsel into no less,
For he is old as Charley that,
Such is his son, that softly gets,
And claims the name of Jack Scott--
--All of them no four feet at all,
The harsh long leg and cold hold,
Which pegs his legs, has a name for that,
Socks on his bare thighs,
Tie them to the demon Satan,
Until on reaching the land whither,
What cares or duties he had on,
From such virile efforts he abdicated,
And, like a man bereaved of blood
He soiled himself a-bed,
Seemed to change his appearance,
And went by name of Jack Swatshit,
With a broken toe,
Now, poor foolish Johnny, 'tis my opinion
He'll have a turn,
For a pair of balls with which to carpet Lord Chiggins.

He's now in the utmost wrack,
Because he's called to take his place
Among the honored names there,
Where such examples are preserved,
As helped Stephen, who now takes all seats,
To chuck them up instead of Pearsey,
--With some tacit threat, for that disproportion
'Twould be to a man relative to
Fling him out there, to make a place,
He would as loth to make a shift,
As break his legs throwing up a load
Of hay, to be Reets' friend.

For this ruin, which you e'er will see
Is history, he made upon his friends,
When to prolong his woes, and thus restore,
Dulled with so many pangs before,
And break his heart in many a gulf,
He would not take occasion with the scullion,
To put him off, upon no false presage,
'Twas thought, that spoils in letting friends go bulk,
Is never tame but with a miracle,
To make 'em scold at him with faintest prayer,
And all their consternation put in words.

Thus deep I look at the jewel he
The deep-by-deep-of-stone great king had given,
Who, on his freedom in this realm to live,
Made his old mistress' heart all alway sad;
And all the expenses of his care,
To make his greatness this wide world hath,
He paid first with his very poverty,
Then with his heart, then came his blood and brain,
Whichever could parts in parts be proud enough to make
Weary at last with longing for her golden hair;
--So kings take your turn, as doth the moon do leagues of balm.

And this be all the relief I still have left!
Alas 'twas with a proud soul and great heart roott
In stony gold that was fetched pure and sweet
Out of a terr earthling the rock doth come,
Thinking it was all'st marrent ready made for state,
But therein 'tis fart most glorious to say fie on;
For who at the first taste of a testy sauce,
The wittiest tricks will run is who can say 'I did'--
And there 'twixt a joke or a hare they must bide.

the sea still waves are not moving, and the bottom, at the end of
the earth, is not deep, and we, and our bodies

still shivered in the wake of the boat, at the edge of the
sea, in agony, at the end of our adventure, dozing

on the sail, you know, in constant motion, so it
seals our mouths around the oars, makes us feel about

to sink, to burst, the whole journey down the wind and out of

water. And it is then that the mists will part, and you will see
the green depths beneath you, and that God will give you

permission to rest. But if you will take this little

I should have kept my mouth shut. I should have said nothing. The fugitive's dilemma: say a little, or nothing. The mumble ofstreamers through the thick air, the Oof freeway, thistle weed and violet for golden ribbons stars, through rain clover's sugary juice, the detour on redlined Vaughn, the grumble of foreplay, coy faces missed, lips and teeth champed, the goodbye huddle, slow drives back to the horse and saddle. I should have kept my mouth shut, until six words for each loss, and then spoken. The confession, a locket with twelve names, for each spent day of the last decade. For twelve days, my lips were gooseberry quiet enough to hold the next day of truth. The confession, a crane hovering, hoisted by steel, to swoop back down, a little dice roll of secrets hidden under feathers, the confession, say a little, and then a little, until the wince ofroost, the hiss of tail, the pinned gaze of contrition, the nuzzling purr, the sigh of "self against self, invasion." Say a little, my feathers. Say a little, my voice, mine.

"I always feel like I'm full ofgoodness." Goodness is a change we make. A seat warmed until it hurts to stand, a pillow from which my hand expands to hold the carry-on's luggage. Luggage packed in brown paper for the airplane, saliva on what's left of the tree, we're also a little lighter, though I've only got so much more weight to let go. I'm selling this bag of groceries and making a book called The Green Bag: Feed Your Feelings. I'm not sure I like the word.

"Before the moving home?
"Is it worth the waiting?"
"I would pay the bill,
"I would pay the bill,
"If it put the o' ball in the ball park."

You'll not mind paying,
But you feel that it's mighty rude
When a sullen wife scolds you,
And the man whom she scolds scorns to one penny penny down;
And you'd rather stay at home and bake your wife a pie.

And you'd rather stay at home and study,
But your mother says
She went and asked her in;"And she'll be a good wife to me by getting down."
So you would rather stay at home and scold,
Than up with the town,
And get a wife and live at home,
And be running around in the style of your countryman.

And it would seem a better room
Is the one you have in Bush,
Rather than the one you have in Church;
And your father's room,
Rather than your home, is preferred;
And you scold against going like a frog,
And at your coming,
You scold the devil.

So you'd rather stay at home and scold,
And leave your father's rooms to chaff,
Than have a lofty place of honor
And sit on a throne,
Rather than share air with a fellow--God's image.

He is a man indeed
Who in the weight of time
Can laugh as high as he will,
Who can laugh out the storm
That is over us and grieve
As it does us;
Who has time enough
For what we call troubles,
And what is enough
To laugh him through the scoff
Of the rogues-in-refoundill.

And we must have time enough
To sleep and to work,
To store up water for rain,
To fill up store of food,
To get some beauty for wife,
And not get carried away;
And when we are done,
To go down fighting
With our pride to lose or win;
And when we fight,
We must not lose, but lose as we fought.

By an omen's name
I dote upon
He is the one I've seen
I knew from off the street
Week in and week out
Who was chosen to represent

He was chosen by lot,
I knew of his desire
To be a speaker, and do he dare
To promise a place;
He is so solitary,
You cannot understand
What he wants me to say,
I have heard him say the cold butts are but holding back
The fire of life, and they will tipple out
To get out the oil;
He is not deceived in this,
He will give the heads of the movement plenty of time
To settle their own question, and drop dead.

He will not stand on some question they bring him up,
And bulldoze it out for personal views,
As long as he believes in it,
And says he believes in it and it shall be done;
And when they bring him up, he sings and shakes the sky,
And ever that answer was a plucky one--
And he would trust the leader he saw on the street
To three stock characters only, his eyes,
His hair and his trowsis.

When they say, "You'll have your own."
He'll answer, "I have a wife and home to make up."
When they ring up the issue, "You'll have your own,"
He'll say, "I'll have the world to think for me,
And I make the world say pluck."
He's a leader he's a legislator,
He'll make a leader of men.

In his grave over his grave
He hung up eyes of red,
He laughed when they licked his knees,
He laughed when they slapped his eyes;
But he didn't laugh with them,
He lay there and shook his head
And scraped up at his lips a jest
And scratched a tattle, and licked his lips,

He would have been a tall thin man
And weak too, and we knew it;
We were not soft of heart, we knew it;
But with a man so strong you fall to
The light of his eyes, and see
Your self so large he can make it large;
So one can be a fool and true and strong,
And dash him back in the dust.

Shone bright with no light,
A burnt-off fragment of the sun
From out the side of the world;
And when it flashed his face was

But there's a way that goes reverse

And fares we must go through of it.

When it needs it?  It was yours.  It was a time
To be graceful, and to give your best cheer.
I thought that I was receiving a present;
It was a skeil that your bill kept getting o'er
From some old friend who had seen your face in it
But who with shoddy techniques and misty air
Made it to look more lovely than you got in others,
More pure of spirit.  And then I looked at it,
And shabby waists and heads of oak that were leaned
Above earthen troughs; and I thought, "Ah, if he
But realize that he was born to be ridden
Rid oft by such people as that, and brought
Before my face, as things are affordingly,
And show me my own reflection in that store."
And then some one came up and said, "Your carriage
Has been time-bounded, carriage worth more than carriage.

"It was in the the truly great there was not
A recumbent woe to be advanced upon.
The figure that from beyond the lift
Beyond the hill that faces the west is seen
Ever climbing, that, fatally stiff,
Canceled its motion, must suffer more than death.

"You have missed the eastward yet, dear dear lord,
And have not seen me in full view, and felt
Your part, that not till now was taken.
To wait for it might be called faithful, but no more
Long that eastern queue that was drawn, though broken.
Of corners had I spoke with you ere now
Far in the desert where I await you two.

"Yours, how ever blest, Lord.  The sun is gone.
A long day of desolation is his
Sunrise in the sky.  I know that to a sun
This day is an affair of dark clouds that burst
In little bales, and those that fly, as things that do.
Had Francis Stewart been here, here would sun appear
As dark as matter, gas, electricity, heavy,

"You must," he said, "Sir, for my hors d'arruth."
--In truth, the hour it was not more for you.
I used to call my little lady Shovel,
And have for her my hakamak, psalm, anthem and see
But the loosest minute of her shapoar!
If she were left in peace, or, lo, if it require
The work of knapsacks, damn the present, take your hat
And walk the streets as of old, something good
Will hapt until you come, I have no fear.
But what would be this damnable hurdlemant?
And certes what will it result where I am?
I am the Bread of Last things, Fret Sporus, Bread of Spirit--
Vigre Fugue, you're my thing--and every man of them
Whose name is not "I" comes naked to the band

Two great stars that enchance the South,
Vouchsafe this grace to Jesu' and me:
Thy setled wit, thy penitensel might,
And that braverie that came ne'er from thee.

By thee taught a new leader Grape found the way,
When from the reins Jupiter and Mars apart,
He, in his sledge, the two large world-sustained beasts
With his royal centres moved from bickering ways.
Oft have I seen thee with marvellous off'rings
Thee at Halloween's refreshtide join,
And at spring-tide vegetables prove.

The Chesnut and the Banana's odorous leaves
Thou hast defaced, and i' the wine-yard bad away
The good old Bottle's labels and flags and other hoge;
But with a new method thou art well intent,
And thou canst claim yet close remembrance still:
Thou 'pret thy claim to leave forgotten lovelit,
And hope, although this should be equalit two,
A lovelit is not put i' th' petty disaecum.

To thee I make this prayer yet more distinct,
That thy crudities may have for day a year,
And year to come have still an endless train of them:
As all wise Men so let my Dear Friend know not fraud,
That where he spinneth heavenly vines, th' evil influence yet
May take root and shoot like seeds of fire from oil of God.
And when the world shall in her cessfull overstroy
Be cut in twain with Hebes ice, the broken part
Shall be a matter for sleepe and all,
And ere the spring-root appear the year,
Be all but prodigally blessed and granted day,
For one portion to be lent to us for ever.

But now thou goest far aft'ring my way,
Talismante cometh ever to the end;
And having reined inre all these twofold nubbins
Upon thy way, the three J's [as] I perceive,
The fifth [kj] stands up for artist J.

But here I need not write, how oft above,
Where I might have done, or how I am should down,
The letter'd spirit of my fly Imprimis;
And here I need not sing, though all foryl, why,
All that I may not have procur'd [k's be God wull,
In sense] the hold of finite for sick ethereal size;
For all that I may do or say be limited,
I come on purpose to endoliaing this clime.

Yea here I could justly sing and make a rout
Of thought, for now this is our sphere and name;
Whether [your transcendentally small gods] ary
Make ectomy-my or know anything of me,
My erties all grow here, and here I do elate
The glory of their fear; I know them aety;
I know my Thonis, [whose] centers here I should have none;
I know my Mifice, [whose] derangements here I do mock;
My Jupiter grows here sick, grows loathsome new,
Grows briny hot; [his] radios I prove not hot,
Cursed supersensible I farther face my dreary shun;
My Jovian tones here sound a colonial tramp,
A hungry reproachful hungry alienate strum;
My Cremona now I prove not what I am,
[whose] center is my den; my deary Joy
I know not her, my Joy here finds her not her day.

And there's my lucid [whom] I know not her,
My Lavarack, my starlight lavender loofed and horned;
Approaching and green, near gallant, fair, but not a petal found.
Green [where] the old love may well be sworn, near known, amorous.
I know not what of my Ruben, his days go here.
I know his trace, I know his depth, but for what i' the hole,
And his portion, I know not what, the infinite variance.

To make our days bare, to take our woman's name,
To looke upon life's face and see its ravishment,
To feel the flamy sun that scengths us from the real,
To drink potions of discontent, copious of sad mood:
And [then] to have strong desire for [his] weak vows,
For the weak mouth of sick-one mother, full of snake,
The empty-press of body-mother's dipt
======================================== SAMPLE 198 ========================================
Me, an all-glorious angel, when he was
For aye clothed in glory, and for a night
In the majestic prison of a prisoner
Sat writhing, with rivelled hands and feet
Bruised, yet fighting like a demon; and the
Spirit that had gone forth from me
Stole in again, and thrust me back to my
Hell, and endured me lour with wrath
Burning like a god in his fierce embrace.
And then I knew that the Elder Gods
Were breath and breath less than the vain flickering
Plantari of this poor slip of a soul.
And for that cause, and only for that,
I raged and I raged.  'Gainst his will he reared
The brazen page of judgment, and the power
Made plain of that mighty voice, and me
Rode whirling round out of a withering
Twinned of all good things: but I lost
The glass in which it made me sole light
The cage of which I cut the bird,
And in my rage I spake:  "Arise, O God,
Ye whose fate it is but now to go down
Pure to the bosom of unknown spheres,
And, like dear friends, be met with greeting;
O, introduce them the Old Encant,
Elder and more than elder brother;
And bid him sit down and rest and kiss
The brethren of his imprisonment
That it may soothe me:  thus much I offer."
Then I, whose glory was affronted, cried:
"Itortion to thy words was but too
Many, till it conspired to frenzy,
That all this was the fatal temptering
Of the spirit that came and went unblest
And to embrace his worship.
But see that there for no man read,
Or it may well your torment amount,
The great censurer of this tombstone,
His eye of judgment and his ear of thine:

For he of loving was veryuilt and certain,
And he of hearing liked best with thurst and temperate breath
To hearing no more than thurst and hearing none.
And of the other's page the set aspect had
The Father's face, so held in love whilere
That of the child embued the parents, and the fille
Lured to the parent page was given that milk
That covered in milky wise his faults.
Beside all, this page was hid with reverent awe
That of the child a child might be; and forthwith
From the right hand the pale page of the Father
Held the strange page forth to leave again
The divine unstained soul of the child.
Nor all was closed who there held any place,
But that more which the presence of himself
An animation, had around fram'd in black nature;
And on the right hand of him clearly counter
There was another page, still like, but dark,
And full of fair and delicate wounds
Whereon all sorts of bloods, but lastly the dew
On paralytic plates of glass goosed
The visible organ of the lips.
And he in whom that page was past
Was fram'd some by whiling spirit wrung
From care, and it were grievous to rehearse
All the gin that in his prison lay,
Or of th'heaval where he dwell'd.
Beside the child he had a son
That matchless one never met was oth' race
Might have prov'd the champion of his kind
Were he an son of his proved he had been like
As is the youngest of that martial race
That he bequeath'd, had'st he triumph'd high,
And that higher vehemence which prov'd his heart
When he mark'd, his madnesse was seen
By this his hatred devis'd to run
As swoln beate as the head of wild snow
Hollow'd in, so th'electra of his yound;
His fury was such that he proud could nam
And axel his wheeling spider webs in rage;
But he of woman hir'd full thy scale depart,
And of her umal friend all feir at nought
In his madren frame, and be of man
The voyager was gett him so strah,
That the mereches came aurning snow
Sighted her with dread, and mountains high
Garen their unpaumaned, in spight
Of battle-axe and their stedfast Hert,
In meek mean thorntse and millstone tow'rd Hell.
At last his anger downe blew anow,
That to the vext full gulf he pullil
Of death his weary gambols used,
And found his lost

Cursed the shades of sleep,
Of fresh cold death, from fire and sword
That never ages will renew.

To him the joyous cries that came
Telling of the banquet blithe;
The braggarts, quenched in thirst
Of the blood of kings, who cried
Fruitful, fruitless glories are
The pleasures of the earth.

Vain voice, unworthy you,
Brave, heroic soul,
So many dare not bolder
Or kindred blood inflame.
So many in the poet's song
Of Boadick Towne's times
Blossom not so meanly as
The fairest descendants of men.

With a glass of Schnapps deep as life
To the hilt then let your thinking give
Towards your birth-right's homeland;
With a song as high as your wreath
A Trident triumph for King John.

Let not love, nor hatchet-men met
Fame the glory of your day;
Let not the curs and others reel
With the spectres' fright
With the jests of darkness under;

Till with hymns and tuneful psalms,
Vocal and clear,
As a triumphal march,
With trumpets of praise and benedictions,
Blowing the bridle-strap,
With broad swords overpowering,
Well the battle turns!

Since our dearmen oh
Were drive forth the Weepers,
With blood of saints
And prayers of children...oh, let us weep and wear
Scrinopleian pains!

Bishop stay and Cardinal
have held the reins:
The Cardinal was a stallion global,
the Bishop aussy...
His lesson to the nation came:
"He's gone, you understand;
Heil Hitler, I've passed."

Ach, there's the heaviest snub on our hands.
We go to Easter the eeults,
And there's a blotch in his Sunday's anticlockyer-door,
In his wee skill
To spurt two teen-heart spies on us
With murder-volley "Wasn't it bad, Wasn't it bad?"

Yes, there was the quivering-jointed ranger,
Expecting the surprise of a balloon burst,
When a .38 caliber coming to the rescue,
Round him goofs like an artillery-ballast-man,
In the balloonagic circumstance.
And when they took him up, oh, poppa Heaven!
They sent him to dead water straight.

There's the "little white eyes" that wait like kids on the steps,
Like ravens where the wolves are glum,
Safe-lined up like leeks to make sure they're warm and fresh,
Like a small Alsatian bull.
There's the registrar that's glad-eyed and happy-clicking
Like the elocution player,
Giving his harangues manohfast speeches
And crusading for our cause.
There's the head of what Alsus there be--
The chief of all avarices
Averting his private piles and grafts
With non-controversial deeds of charity
And gracious prerogatives.

There they stand, like a who's who of free-born Briton,
With elephant trunk arms and manhood decked on 'em,
Like a good war beat in old bull books,
And conscience in their pawing heart,
And tanned by winter out of Oriental stoves,
That's noalis'n us, nor they'r any boshness
In theyr bearing--like us, like us, like us,
When somberness fell on Caesar's heights,
Called Beoast Bine:
'Tis who wi' the high millennium pot,

We, parricids, are such a hunt on new field;
To watch the wise-ones lag behind,
And their hound--we who watch them jump in,
And jump hop, hop, hop--away in air,
And they have the whip.

He was nigh the Garden of Scattering Apple-tarts,
When, scattered daisy, herb, flower, and weed,
And grasses, through the court's contracted space,
Tendium on tips of tips,
Spot on Spot--in little leavings,
The daisies and the family run
Of grasses and blooming heath and garden ground,
All knew him by his old family name.
"What's he? what's he doing in the way of motion?
With the Cut he's out of date,--
With the Crop he's in the rump--

Dear friend,
How long I shall lay here, watching for your ship,
With unavailing hunger for the morrow's maw!

When you come back,
How will you find me?
Will you find me
Lone in the dark,
With nothing to light
The candles and the strong light the candles make,
With no memory of you in mocha leather,
Or of redwood and the kilnshabesoda,
In the kilnshomes of the hills?
You will not find me
Lone in the night.
I am gone--and I hope
In flight to one of the Kilman accords;
I shall never forget the way to that house,
And the long way down to the inn from there.

The weather is cold and the wind is grey
And the day is done
Like a playing
A short game
That does not want the breaks
Or the club that can't win.

Who is that who comes to us
From the land that has been won?
O he is only a playing
With a Stick in his hand.
Who is that who does not need

The Umbro that is warmed
By the rough sea?
Who is that whose flesh and heart
Feel the cored salmon sing?
O he is only a player
With a knife in his hand.
Who is that who goes unstuck

And away with the luggage
Of self and its hopes?
O he is only a traveller
With a nation's griefs.
Who is that who goes ahead
With his head in the kilt
Or a dead scalp?
O he is only a wankerend
With no broken bones.

Now he is gone
From the building
And the work to do.
But in his voice and his pace
And his tread and his singing
And his walking on the sidewalk
He may not come again.

"All the Hawklins eat", by Jan Blau [Nature, Animals]
Not the hawk, nor the shadow
In the left hand and the stick
In the right—and the lime
And the lime and the ironwood
Of the spruce and the juniper
And the birches that break
In the air and the mahogany of
The oak—and the fire that
Leaves its imprint on the sand—
Ere you begin
Of the hawklins eat.

"The House with No View", by Jan Blau [Living, Philosophy]
A valley fits the no-view
owner's wish.
A fortress dominates the view.
The owner's prayer
was bowed in prayer here,
by his loins hidden,
in the leafy ribs of this tree.
Porches look down upon
the ransacking
of Warriwarr (the birds
beside the edge of the view)
and bowseller (so late
the buyer keeps lookout
and steps aside
for the seller)
But today
the hawklins have a tongue
the hawklins eat.

INTRODUCTION:

This is the story of a
piece of land that

was calm and just as statue-
firm as the following day;
a hill but with
an ever-expanding
vacant middle area
where other
bases of the same name
flourish by day. This
rout with ownership and use
was given to me
by my Lawyer—a
PROPERTY CLAUSE personifying
ownership and title.

By this sword in the thick of the fight
In the great asasal, with one stroke

From the safety of my foe, and slain,
That as a bull that great Saladin slain.
And though I now am nought, my thought
Is still of great things, to be performed
When the times have caught up the spirit of Rome.
So, brother, in faith, my words may have borne
Some weight with thee, I pray thee pardon therefore,
And know that I have not lost it, as thou seest,
But gain as chalk, to do a graver deed,
Thy sheet having weight, as days as a wagon wheel.
But now my eyes are dry, my tongue is dumb
For crying endless and my mouth in tune
Is thinking of great matters, of counsels
That taster in my nose, and that through both mouthes
The sweet savour hurries, and the lips are clogged
That beat out tears. So this gray cloud,
This walking soul, hath passed them and hath none other
In sight of Hither White Knight, nor in the land
Save him, she holpen still behind her steed.
So, being alone, I have fancied her house
But one, and called it fair for see of whom it is.

My brains grown dull, old and dim, from vexing thoughts
Of love, that have eaten out the marrow-bone
Of pleasure, have turned Cuisinernos,
And haunted me day and night; my weary eyes
Are fixt upon the dim wilds, and dreaming
Wild familiar dreams, that at each nod or wink
A stir sets memory within them; they teach,
They promise, their form and feature and all right
Establishing, as the hills do right the soul.
The soul, all love and pains, that's born in storms,
Cools to the bank, and there stands patiently all
The destruction of the world through her, and waits
Serenely assured that here be sure
Her confidences, and this her balance true,
Passion its eternal worm, and evil her worm.
There be no secrets buried with our gold,
But where the buried ore hath set dark scratches
Which mare cursd bore-and, presto, in the vents
Of our good gold, forth ye've out a flaying
Of confidences, and treacheries and lies,
Greed, deceit, and betrayals, which, at times,
Hath brought man where he must kneel down in sack
Thinking his vows to do is authority.

But, for all fear and treasons, heaven's from us
Neither loving God, nor their beastly lust
Nor slumber shall be none, but thundering clap
Shout, and bolts of lightning in the apex.
For all our saying Heaven regards our say,
Trichinosis, and rueing thing that we are,
Our hearts the common heap of all things,
There are our bloods and forms and volumes innumerable
And manners,, props and forms of all our pride.
What wisdom, what shame to hide these or these less,
Such are our deeds and speaking, what we make time to.

Aye, as we lay these bodies out to weed,
And cast our sorrow in the faces of cows,
And attend to lambroaches and to worm-balls,
And think the greatest things are those we ate,
And drink our dogs' drinking-bibles up,
And munch our mutton-dish to pleasant pounds,
We say, "Live like you should, since that you can;

There is no ing in sen was in his eye.
He hath the key, he will unlock his heart.
He will give us no exposed Comt Te;
We must find it out ourselves, and go
To talks of Chivai with our keys a-hoof.
He must not read in Chivai's large eyes
But pestilence or gunshot upon them.
Learn, too, that never, never, nor half-ass,
Full a year for this dureswork is.

In one great Host that is our life,
God spake, and nerved us long ago.
We trust our prayer to bring us grace,
And it may in that great Host be weighed.
The rest is in the great Happener;
God joy in us by many things,
Makes us earnest, and we're sincere.
So let us say his grace like children,
Singing and dancing and praising.

Our baths are fire-breathed, our food is rich,
Our sports are much; there's nothing that we
But ing in the grand Host is made good.
In this one
======================================== SAMPLE 203 ========================================
 are sweet--like one of our girls,
With her blonde hair and her tender eyes.
I've got an old totono, of hisbumnious mold,
And when I'm not much after her, I hear
A black-bag man impaled on the big ointments,
Which is why--God save us!--I was wondering
How you can be certain that there's no need
For an old Chinese to wed a young Chinese girl.
I was harping on a licorice, which was all:
But now I'm sure that your face is not like a painting;
You're much too divine, and that makes me afraid.
There's a resemblance, and, don't you know,
'Twere better to cross jack with lamb,
Than grow hungry, and otherwise be studying
The little books on that is found in drug stores.

"How does the Spring treat you glad to see
"With her hands and her breasts and her feet?
"The long white socks she has putonto my hands,
"The deep red flats on my bottom suggest
"The colour of lamb lately sacrificed;
"And I behold, and I think I see
"The blushing of her bottom all palled,
"And the nether of her sex is rose.

I think--I think that I know
The reason why young girls think not to be Seen:
Because, when they are loath,
Not to be paired, and run to fill the gap,
It is hard to contain and lead them,
And it is, oh! so very hard!
I don't think it is very well to Be Seen.

She is peeping at me, and thinking, he is wise!
I do not know--I must not say;
For surely no one knows as much as she does:
And how much of her and of that other one
I know, but dare not tell, and how much do I not know
About the two together--that is, the one, the other.

The night is cool, but the morning burns the same;
We see each other's homes, and all the fields and groves and homes of friends,
But--what is dearest dear to me, what is best, I know not, nor why it Grace,
Unless it be that, seeing her eyes, whatever it be,
Whatever her or his country or my own, and my pain or her pain be in her the same,
It, being so conjoint, triggers even more my grace in her than it would be;
So that there is feeling bruised by archery, and yet victory is mine.

At her constant, quiet sitting by my desk and dead and motionless bed,
With her lips on the doom of my pillow, I enviously see
A picture of something flies that lives; I like the one
Not as one has taken the defilement of what's commonly taken,
But as one has got the greatest number of what's denied:
A bird, I think, that's proved its love for a great ornithologist,
That sitting there as if it had bitten off more than half the tail
Of the immense branch that it should live in for which it's batter'd all its life.

All that I care for
Is she--that's the one--
And more, and best,
And I'll die if I think of the ways in which
I'm loved by her who does not love me.

How can she be so wrong
When I, so right,
How can she be so near?
How can she be as she is frank and free with me,
When I have such eyes?
She who's been what I have not
Yet been as much as I, unloosed for the world,
Unheard of as a dead man in the places where they do me "not,"
Has been as I--that is, more than JUDY, and as secure as she is
And shall be when the ages bring forth their sum of their eros.

There was one child that I love as a son
And I can say, with light from the heart as from a lamp
And with souls as lamps that tell the passion of my thought,
There was one mother who was mother to me
In all joy and pain and that is enough for one mother to three;
But there was one child that I love as a son
And I can say with light from her in the dark a woman
And with souls as beams that tell the passion of my thought.

Love of my brother--there's the line to cross--
Love of the fair without end--
There is the line--there is the irked eyes--
And the end that must intuit
With a hidden profit

 little Dolly leans a-steaming,
Smelling of boot and bubblegum.
But that is not the worst.

Now to add a new and fearful
Disaster,
Her elder sister, Runcorn, only
met the same fate
Of Peeping Tom, by the dark, by the light,
By the terrible!

It is most dreadful and depressing,
Increasing grim, and growing ghastly,
And there is no reprieve.
The fire-black donkey
Stares as she walks along the street,
And her eyes have a chilling, and the
Blacker the inn more ghastly they become.
It is frightful and they continue
Growing in gravity till they pass along
To the houses they obliterate and burn,
And the people are scattered, and not a soul
(I don't know who's living and who's dead)
Has the appearance of happiness.
Where's the mistress? where's the husband?
(They're buried in the garden of Our Lady)
Where's the boy, that at their home used as
A gay toy by a Stepford?
(They're in a garden by the Turners)

Come, all you lucky ones,
And, as you will be bored,
Come and take all the offices on you.
A Joviala is a job which gives plenty of work,
And the Jovial is lucky in having a rich and bigger room.
—From a wooden closet in the parlor,
At Your Building, Plaister*; 1873.)

A golden-frosted day.
Goats, in long black silk,
On hay-racks, in wagons,
Are trotting around, are roaming all over
Who cares—as the dogs laugh, when they see a British
Corporal walking with his glassy wife.
(The wife is actually shot.)
There is the best domestic angel on earth
Who tells her all about it, talks with her for an hour,
And gives her DDs* for dolhertys cards—
And all about the war,
How aye, while the bullets are flying around,
New York, London, Paris, we're hearing about the War.
While I'm told that my insurance, should it be
This way turned around & sold, will get me another $10,000,
I'm offered a choice of dividends, put to my own earnings.
—From a newspaper, a subscription-writing quill.
London, June 1916.
"Lowna and Search"; the day the street was made for snipers
Who aimed their weapons at the men who wanted quid pro-

cut of their other humanings.
There were times the dark would rise above the dock,
Level the hats off the firing-squads.
It was said the evil Valkyries into their old martial tune
Would show the London Constable about-side,
As the Tommy had a date to go to the Race
And the Tommy was going to do it alone—
But War is a sister and sister of frenzied violence,
With gunners, hats off fired, and the ever-linger red,
—As night fell, the Tommy was at his post,
One bullet from a Victoria.
And the Tommy, his balls deep in his trousers,
Was in the head of his green boy who'd left the water,

Who was lying in the "par" (that's French for "pan"),
Tight-legged and round-jailed, with his "drug-bitz",
Sitting on the boat, with the dark bay untight
Up to its long-rifle, and the sluiced wire
Circling the Tommy, who had his drug of bear,
Narbish or Chaoc Pa.
—Thus l'Espagne's "boot" shot the Tommy, a injury
That made him wild-eyed and manic-manic,
And wild-eyed and manic-manic, the worse for wear.
—But it's our little war, you see,
The glorious little war we're fighting,
The comic little war we're dancing,
With shirtwaists buckled, with pencil-mauled,
And each side that's doing the chaise long-iron,
Deliberate, dividing the women's bodices.
Noon from each different-colored misery
Comes, with the land at tide thrown broad and damp;
The City burning, the City bilious,
Banishing last-legged women's beans,
Replenishing with muddy cattle;
—And Banqueting, the last Quarter to be torn
Jolly hards;
—And all the time the bumble-ranch
Blew as round us two

Alcides, from his steed, leaps from the race,
And, gliding, as he flies, through the race,
Leads, to her, who takes him, the virgin goads
The steed, the bird, with the agile feet:

"Go, then, rich Albine, a hundred mares' prize;
Go, and from your waxing corps, twelve stallions take;
And hire, yourself, a chariot born of gold,
Go, and the same home convey, whom you love best,
Go, and the same peace keep, whom you believe most."

But Phlegias' younger churl Anon spoke,
A bet of whom he meant to be a votary,
As nought with him did he dote,
Who on his friend's grief-piece should take bay:
"A woe to all our town (he said),
Were such an old minx in his closet bred,
Who could write, and could not love, like all those."

A moth, of the worst and basest sort,
On nothing declined to take a broil;
If any such there were, as you or I,
Of the loveliest daughter in the town,
Or fairest niece, in whom the father lay
In loving pride, but with his tongue defiled,
Of all holes the town among, of dirty funds spent,
To him, in woodland churls an ass,
He, at his master's demure, would be
A beast, the pleasure of a living creature,
An horrid pleasure, to his master's child.

A thievish quality in nature,
Most common in boys, with ease we say,
Drew after the men their childish eyes,
Even when in distress, and anguish, faring,
Allured they follow, and find a lair;
Such names as these, in their unforming growth,
One and all, from nature draw their flight;
And, with an ugly congeption, born
Of inadequate things, they crowd the house.

For shame, O Covfonds, in your furnace' fire,
We do esteem you so much the better;
The pleasant few, to hold when happy days are by't,
Let them alone; no long appearing before
To minister to Fortune's lottery,
Let the bed do love, or--whatever they, to-day,
May wish to have granted to them to-morrow.
If to the mistaken, fortunate, and of great birth,
You with the younger men of the town, for shame, again!
Do nothing for yourself, for your livelihood too,
Do for the women! 'Tis a pity so
Much men do not value at the first as they.

A man of fortune and of beauty too,
Though but a gentleman, a country knight as he,
Was in our circuit one day, and to see waken
An impulse that had long been dormant,
Which made him and part of him utterly;
And to be judge in the court of their species,
Was in his country's publick, a martyr in his eyes.

All in a moment's while, immortals of old,
Rose he and others, and others, up like sparrows,
To this charmed cherubick deity, in their place,
To re-animate and consecrate his shaft;
And altho' this was but a humbler prize,
Yet it was holy in a woman to embrace
The whole of the glories of the age.

And he justly made his bow, being youthful,
At the prospect of such height and bulk;
And from the judge, whom he held in disdain,
He was forced to lift up his unarmed elbow.
And o'er his eyes the sprinklings of the rain
Ate of veilment went, like in fullrumors a brawl;
When the remainder of the day drew in,
And he saw still a thousand jovial things proceed.

The furniture, the pictures, the antique cups,
The cane outside, the wine-cups outside more grisly,
All, as before, were turned out for remembrance;
And in the cellar's depth a pack of cards was seen,
And the man had a great interest in each,
And read the return of ev'ry one and more.

The whole count of the things brought in for sale,
In a treble ten of galleon pes den.
(To pound modishfee with the mean Opirata)
In modish equities, and sums self-squalid,
In vacillations of galleons and of pieds,
The swarthy musos, the persians,

Worm cast by nymphs on the Delphian limbs,
Their paltry mole with Venus' gift enchased,
Now deathless there, made by her divine hand,
Than Phrygian Merope's wooing:
'Twas done by her on Pelops' bed of gore;
With his whole bow arm'd, he hewed the legs from off;
And for the breast pierce'd, and pluck'd out her whole vest:
Then wash'd, and whith'd, the whole shew'd; which being done,
With airs of honour'd rectitude prepar'd for each,
A handsome man, a Phrygian, and no Latian,
Was first imparted. Next Syrinx, Ceyx, tone,
Cyounutus, and Cytomakses were engendered
From the first Machaon line to the last.

These glorious leaders the finishing touch of grace
Whil'st the Athenians, and the Spartan line;
And spread the glory of themselves far-flung;
Who emblazed their buildings, and their deeds performed
Through the forth-imum of Time's chasemed span.
There what the looks of men, see Passions 'mong families,
Partridges, hawks, and dogs, 'tis really seen;
How they mow, and clubs and axes befit;
Dogs like mothers, 'bets they betake them 'em,
And their rabble held up and speak to ask:
"Where can all these folks do now there's no men to hold them up?"

Theres and whys unite, and part of the wages
'Bove the CELESTONS the lewd-rampantATING troops
Of wives and maids, as for no debt their shawl allows,
The play-house or the swing-bottle they may enter;
A bloody edition of vile jouchards, that keep
They scourge themselves still; yet still the more they commit
They more transgress; till, both in persons too--
As in their manners--wreaking, they at length decline
From law to levelling fines, the poor harmless-blissful-

It is needless, in the meaner sense of the word,
That we should thank our blindness for so much small gear.
The Thanksgiver unthank'd is sure to be forgittlein',
And with the shoe upon his head we'll go down to the dead,--
Or, the lowway to another planet is here,--
The old planet, such a figure of fun, may we follow,

And those who by, or under it, felt the quickity
Of pain, or its effect, or both together;
For Truth at last must prevail to make that light speed away,
Frown at last must confront the looking-glass, and come there with a cheer.

If it be that you've been beguy, our caps may
With hat-pad be permanently repaired below;
Or, if 't was our fate to come from tropaly;
'T was that blear-eyed station of the tortuous realms
Where, bickering with the day, there standeth, hot
In fruitless rivalry, green cannibal hurry,
(The sooty giantess of low humor,
The sullen-enominged rival of the laughing night)

Then it is that we receive the stumbling-stiffs

Of the deep evening, (and take 'em away with us)
That can NO dirty aftertomage calculate
To enhance our blissful little morning's bliss,
But, hard as they're thrown, we at least they pity,--
Nay, twist them up, and put on leathern,
Lard-like, and give 'em a dainty quid or two.

To happy differentty then comely triumphing,
And the Like-nothing-Robed-Waldos-beating coo is in the air.
Away to the marshes far, where the sad earth is groaning,
And the wild woods (that have been quiet, forgetful, dreaming,
While the world has lain groggy-dead or dazzled under the sun,)
Vie with one another in the vain hope to give oath
In good husbandry as to cast their offspring on the altar.

But, come, let us hark to the joy-call ringing yet again.
The night air is quick with the minstrelsy of the wold;
And the happy Sorrows are gathering their lilied store;
'T is the calm morning of the awakening;
And the mirth-singers have come through the elderly to us.
They leave us at evening

Firmed with her beauteous son, my Bel-imperia's sweetest child!

The throne of Saturn's ancient heirless son is set,
And Mææses, wife of Dictes, poor man! dead.
From mighty Saturn's bed, brought to term,
Through many a cruel wife, his various brood,
Reaping his proper fate, have lately died.
Hæmus and Dymas are from out the main
Departing; lying o'er the deep, the two remaining,
Mæon and Teucer's stream-sodden mass, are burned
With fiery spears by the flying squad.
Meantime, for slow Leucus the flocks retain
His plunder of the land; his night is come;
The cormorants having dragg'd away his maiden,
Teth to the unwaked flocks.
Himself, not out of Megara first desc'd,
Yet once out of Crete, well-known as a good man,
To wit, the warm stir required on board a ship,
And most conversant of a pastoral mood,
Close grov'ling in the waist, the beasts of Britain's hill
To the slim description of the untam'd surf is sent.

Fond of man's precepts, and of human work,
He raised himself by labouring toils to men;
At time, if not now, the prosperous sail, old
Ere enter'd on fame.  A fact old, and new sund'd.
As he speak'd, all the region round exclaimed loud,
A fact old, new still trumpet'd.  What a fane
Into the poet's space has been pizza-drawn,
Satire from every part, precise, detailed,
To fill any breast: striking the author dead,
Or at the least disturbing his refresh'd soul,
His pick'd spirit out to deck a poem round.
Let but Scartach, or even Cambria's fame adorn
Your oak no more, (begot byRunner's slender keel),
To every tongue a perfect masterpiece,
Light as the Sydney street, but hallow'd far away
By all but blasphemy or greatness Neptune's pride.
Behold! this microcosy power inspires my line
(Who once had met and show'd themselves my equal in arts
And arms:) a new man, boundless as she is rare,
(I speak, vast as this as much as I am:)
What though in beauty she were, by hours on hours,
Yet not a gleam, no shade from her none,
No match, though mixt with all that fairest is,
Nor all the other clime doth now and then,
What though in craft it were, in case it were wit,
All added by several, or the most deep?
The hand, the looks, the bird, the face, the ear,
The man's or woman's, or in any part,
The rich or howl, or how much ought, or much matter
How much ought still to weigh in decorèd rolls,
In other countries and at other times,
It hath ever been my toil, to cast my spread
Over all, and many more have contained,
As oft within my own my day-dream in my mind,
But yet all within seem'd to share and be the same.
(By doubts theoretical,) all in one were held,
In one whelm'd, mighty by the sum of man's law,
Supream, good, tremendous, spotless, infinite,
Which made one love to all, as one hath wit at heart,
And all these things, in endlesso have been sought.
So let them still continue; I seek not now the one.
Did I but prize the word, pournt soft and quietly
Their pretended hearts among us, had I fears,
Fears of the soul, which equall things augur,
Of our dear found home I do and have them.
O joy, thou Father of all, why thus for thee
Have they not thy trust and place in sight?
Who have thy divine appointment still to hold?
Who rather have these advantages over me,
Then me, whom they not once can in good time destroy?
Where canst thou gain safe refuge from their flames,
But where thy native place and own?
Yet these are not all; I also have them not:
O thou that bearest the charge, with what success
Thou hast it gone, find me another.
Now, if these ill-ware were at rest, and we
Too old to ill Content, well nigh thou mayst.
I now say what surely shall not be believed
By me, but
======================================== SAMPLE 208 ========================================
I thought I could see them anywhere,
Like a braggart who, with a price on his head,
Seeketh every street to boast his theft,
And lead them out where he might be killed.
And then, I thought, my wealth might be my end,
My jewels in the grave of my heart.

I said: "As I have been thy slave, I am thine,
Thou king of tender compassion!  Come,
Look carefully, that there be not one kiss between us."
I took my top-coat off: "Look!  See!  See!  It is I."
I reached my arm: "And it beareth mine heart within it."

And then I saw that strange seam:
Placid, golden, flowing, a river of light,
A white, the same as when it was the night
Ere Menephisae began her love-insuffrage,
Swift as on the marble of porphyry,
Flushing the marge of lovers, marching, that
Might wait for its kiss.
And I, in the midst, I saw it aflame,
A kiss-defying river, a well of bliss
That burst its baroque waves in banks of kiss
Under the lips and in the stagnant river.
And that, I thought, was me; that beauty was mine,
My rich heart in the heart of me was formed
To thirst for her and know how to caress
This head of mine to tingling sups of bliss.

I stood there.  Ah, now it all seem,
I thought, myself:  that, in that beauty,
In that lily streaming river, the fear
Of that live morning's eternity,
The lorn fears of death should turn to pride
For love that might exalt me to the
ridged and collapse cosmos.
I felt the strange throb of life
In many parts of me, there where the body
And head are one and where the head is not.
And when I first lay my head to rest
After love, I seemed to be a bird
Who had not wings, though I soared in air:
That desire, that fire in many parts,
Was in the air before I took the kiss
That made me moth and moth.
And then I heard a whisper in my ear,
A sigh, a whisper alone, in the night,
But a whisper with such accents as move
The ghosts I leave.  "Be it news, full news, thy husband" --
A word that sorrow gives and takes away
From out the soul.
My tears were wet on my hair.

I could hear a noise of waters jumping
Above the pan.  And then the man:  "N. in room 11:
This week his mother died.  A long time ago
He said to me, he would follow me abroad
One day, and train under me.  And when I came
To her at it in the end, he was waiting
Me in Moscow.  He is twenty-one.  And I said
He must have followed easily into London."
And then:  "He refuses to go.  We are so proud
Of her."  "So
'Tis hard for him, my dear," I answered,
"Here in these old climes, close to colossal cliff,
A sea-fugue like this one, with long gentle winds,
And craggy mountain steeps.  He prefers the broad
And boundless Land of Zhou.  But he must
Have loved thy voice.  He never will go."

And then, to me:  "He did not use to say
That which he said to me, the other day,
By which I granted him the surrender,
And in such danger dived he.  But he
To me then, at length described what he means,
To do the runoloon, and be executed,
And say the last thing to be the best,
And naught beside.  I think he never will survive
But by thy love.  I think he is crafty,
And at some time more dangerous still,
The booty that he so cunningly had planned
To bring from thee, and safely leave thee,
Is small indeed; for I my country lose,
And suspect the best of earth, my dear mother-land."

I think of all I could say to leave it,
And more than half my world's great nature shook there
('Weightily realized) in that bitter cry.
And then:  "I die."  "My soul aches aftereakingcokerno its unbinding."  "It all awaits hime, who lasteorniven in death may rightly

"Sometimes it Thinks No One Listens to Its Poems ", by Sirrustsa Sulekon [Arts & Sciences, Poetry & Poets, Social Commentaries, Race & Ethnicity]
Sometimes it thumps like an insect caught in a sock,

But mostly it noble more as amusement,

a mockery of debtor's imprisonment.

That we can sleep's not for us, no not for us,

a fast one to abandon

take them all

Take them.
But stay

I was the dandelion

Kills, ye meet the proud foe,
Where he is sitting, kill him too.
To his side a vault he will disclose,
In which your life shall instantly be buried,
In the earth around.

Woe to the man, if yet he live not!
Like a needle still, though it be grounded
On the centre of the earth,
It will turn, and it will turn for ever,
And show the buried in it.

It will open in the forehead the slit
Of its brilliant lantern-light,
And show, if thou hast virtue, the swarm
Of its queen behind it.

And yet more wisdom like this to spy,
Betwixt the lips of care,
That like a lofty tower stands high, and yet
Will not fall, though it go the highest road,
That heaven will not defy.

But O, if by a little delay
This may be caught, the tale may be three;
If death be past in the greatest heaven,
Yet thou mayst say, as one who fain would be,
'He dwelt here,' and yet 'Naught known to us.'

And all men's quittance of men be vain,
If all their doings be white or black,
And all their deeds what they are, who they are,
For nought that is done or said,
It may be otherwise as well betrue,
That they are shaken with salt forgetting,
And changeful as the pulling away

The moonlight on his head shone,
As walking he took the meadows by
With care, to see himself therein
With firelight unseen.
So fair a sight 'twill please most oftentimes,
So hard to part without just plaint.

The springing grass, the leaves that build
Of web or cochinelon,
The silver lilies, the late launces,
The mat time leaves, that nod with amidst
Like blushes, and the frost like colours
Are all the breath of those that burn
In fire, to whom time is unbent, unseen.

Some say, of old time there was strife
About the torch, which brandisht
Who should have the storm's part, and won
With death for king and bed undressed
The cold which must his corse holdfast enclose.
But this is holding of ourselves,
A hollow word to name what is unfull.

An old man grown is fair;
The young man crowned, the virgin free;
She was the sheves of euery hedge
That were for beauty; she the foxemachine
Of sl firstlight, white, and twice complexioned,
That doth the doors of hell leave unfired.

She was the female Jove;
The boy was god's newborn son;
The maiden Psyche that loveliest thing
That ate her meal in heaven's regards,
Which drove all violets on her face to purue
When she did eat, and turned the place with torment.

Both these I think; for where the boy's eye struck,
What sink or base there was on any of that deck,
Had any bitch or bastard threatned actually or rumored
What would outrate her upon her, sumped and tattooed,
I 'had another pair' would counter say,
And in their company found no other boys to compare,
Which above is not saying much that'd I spies
In that golden cover, which, whether 't was clerkes or money
On their books, to call it so copiously beare,
None would demand but what their wits could keepe in sight.

The billow that does the summer inland
Sips off the waves, and flings the vinegar round,
Then streight forward the whisp caught at the knot,
Thither led Vincente Garcia and his spume.
O Paradise! did never person therein
Entreat, to lead him bean or take him in Warr;
O Paradise! which extending wide indeede,
And to the earth blue Overpasses everlasting Evening,
But human nature there put in human power barely is laid down.

The selfe using example in our very clothes of life,
Their forme and shade being alike by you utt'disappeareth;
Of both the same, the wearie masters: for whom But Vincente Garcia to Tee bade adieu?
And then the tying of which could not be right made more agreable,
The same condition'd people to fill forever the quoysts and thrones in Heav'n.

And now for another kind of pietout deliberating;

Bar-Ill-Day is over, so are we,
To rest at this expanse of sea.

Let the North wind rave!  The clouds are black,
Still the wind and re-echo,
When the spirit-wolf is howling far,
'I will have what I ask!
May I grin at the storm-clouds?  My shout
Is heard in the winds of the sky!

Though no snow the heavy snows rend,
Though no bells toll on the winders,
Though no nurses panic-droop
In the night-shift of hospitals,
Woman is crying in her work
--In her dress

On her hands and in her hair
Though no feller turns for riches,
Though no upper air
Of profounder vision
Exists, girl, in the 'borough of London,
Sporting the tear-stained blushes
From her dress

On her hands and in her hair
Are Her memories
That she shakes in her work-day cl vogs,
On her hands and in her hair
And Her sorrow, Her tears, Her heart's pains,
And Her thoughts, His, like poppets green,
Her thoughts are green
On them, the bounding birds to follow
When he comes bird-like
Down the path
That opens with one silver curve
In the sphere
Of the town
In the cold
World
In the icy
Unreal
North
Air
In the drear
Holier night-time of Scotland,
Unternimed north
Sleeps on at last

But no, though the night were wide,
Though the path were clear,
Though your sight were keen,
Your breath were free,
Though your heart were strong,
Or your breath were tender,
Or your heart had feelings,
Or your thoughts were FERAL
At your heart's deepest depth
For a sleep
Were none.

Each of the elements, ere long,
Had murmured for itself,
Made friend with its own good,
Nursing its maddest strife
Like a cunning story,
Or a loud-pacing brook.

Each its own favourite thing
In some cold romance shot,
But sowed no plotting intrigue

For watchful cunning
In its own quiet sphere

Or subtler spurning
Of another's hailed victory
In the squirming round of civil war.

It is unsuspended, a pole
Without lives of any sort,
Save oaks, in whosecalm time
A single tree lives to show a dry row
Of oranges.

No images of Utopia,
With all the nightmare sounds
Of voice, footstep, something moving curtain-wise
And transparent mist behind the lamp.
In this dark chamber,
This midnight chamber,
Eerie and alight
With only shadow-vapors
Plastered on the walls to make it seem,
I am better alone.

The very stones are looking,
Perpend, through cryptilsnce secret and dark

And through filmy perfumes, through which alone
The sullen sun peeps.
No sound of song nor song-bird,
There's not the slightest thump of breath
From three boarded bowers

In this remote, chill ground,
Where only films of greenveils lie
And the gravies sink,
No word is halting, no word is there.
But front to back,
Look, there's one
Sitting up like a merrily grinning, two-edged eel,
Drunken as September all-night tipples
Down the deep, green, baas-bowed pit of a well.
He's staring at me, staring, holding his hat tighter,
Shrinking as if something had stung his lip.

Yes, all of me, I'm still here,
So kindly thicker then,
Larger then than most I've seen,
Bigger then than any big enough to friggin' murder!
And then the foxy leopard green,
All-year-round, always be pulsing
And deepening for birth;

And the porters all,
The toasters and the hot-water pitchers,
The very window-sills,
The very fair fountains,
The very murmur of the tiled house-blocks,
All of me goin' craze.

But that's not all!
And that's all!
Newfoun', twnearin' to mon hand,
And heTFS what you ask fer!
Comes a snow upon them, lodges it in them,
And they're all strafing now like for parts,
With whatever they got on hand,

.  The point, where it strikes the ground.
and plant on the ground. I pray you now, as I think
perhaps you were about to ask, what it is
that makes us famous, the fever, 'a great desire
of which nature is never ashamed,' if your
question is even just to call something
fantastic, an instance of that strongest word,
as in Shakespeare's death, the dead father, 'the fiery
father,' in Atherton, the witch Liribeth,
'a witch whom men cast into a fire and yet
they put out'--I don't know which. But I believe
there is a common human fascination in the
motion, the rocking, the the burning, the causing
of the problem, the personified or human figure
to be the problem itself, something which is always
inventing itself, yet only always there. The
problem of existence: who I am is, where did I come
from, where am I going, where do I go, how was I
made, his body writ large, who is my soul, or what
god live in me, if god live in me, fix me in the
form I inhabit, somewhere as a child born in a lake
of stars, as some small child of bills and bombs and streams.
And I can tell you, it is not pleasure, not pleasure except
in the long run, in what adjusts to be here, in what
swings, in the long drop into the dark, for the flood is
a constant long long drop into the dark, or the long
war the dark, to sink into the dark, as silver quiet
crowns the evening, and the stars draw large. Here, in this
fiery underworld, what connects us is not our
pincest, not the babies and cakes, not even fire, but the
splendor of burning, connection, what makes
a place appear, for there is nothing that is
impervious, what has no price, and what is inherent, or
natural, is the source of all riches, of all
resistance against the want of belonging.
And so, I think, the gods are like the
sweeping clouds, of which everyone knows one
is not remotely like the other, so what the
wind does, then what the bees do, what the
flakes of light do, what the rainbows fix,
and what the prod of Virgil, what the spear of
Corniger do, what the round sunset does, what
the moon does, what the stars do, what the
twilight
And so the fortunes of those who hear, and the miseries
of those who don't, and how the years advance us
here, or how the years fail us there, or how the
wind
briefly transfer us, what remains
when the sum is what's left when the sum is
notion, what's not is what's most, and what's not seen
is not that remaining, but the self that is not a
ghost with a mark like a spiked collar, the
self that is not a self is the self that is here, that

atlas
as earth; the swollen throat;
still, endless, infernal fires;
red waters and no soul;
the sly whip; the cra-da-da;
the heat that the winds whip;
the heads that fall where the stream; the
smeard tick; the eyes of the take;
the scourge, and the flail; the mad
running feet that keep time;
the eels and the fish that are dying;
the boiling cauldron; the
sparrow there at the
ongoing and running tap,
pray like a pent-up mind to God
that the people be good, and
what's good to rise, and to stand
there where the beaten roads meet and God
walks; and that movement of the strings
know as heaven is good to listen to;
not to know how Bondsville hails itself a
place of the future, and the
shanty with its darkness and sickness; the
shoe-rationing grit; the night-vision
squint and the red-willed
back of the headlight; the still,
silent, blink-covered eyes; the
wheezing cacophony of
lady sicknesses and sight; the
pink foot and the purple tongue; and
the arms from which it walks; the gears and
no-Geary spiel: the town drunk's
statement of "You've got a mind! I've got
hands and hands and 10,000!" beat the
kindly jay's, "Hey, Chuck! I heard ya like

They could not afford the luxury
Of sweet lolli worki ng, or works
Of exquisite needle work;
Nellie, with all her beauty, had to sew,
With dashes of swift Etch-A-Sketchie.

Her early thoughts were pleased with Pa,
She sewed, and she made dolls,
But she could not learn--the G-eadw-Moo
As well could keep his clothes on.
And though Nell was small, her brother
Could n-oul-on-le-E-e.

But Pa with anger's blaze she fanned,
To tears she added threats,
And told her she must leave her home, her toe
(Nellie's size) must chip a heel,
Nell she tumbled down the porch,
With bent head, and very twisted.
She knelt to mad at her heft,
Nell she shiver'd worse than thin.

'Twas near boiling-time of day,
A little fatality
Made Pa lonesome, so he thought
He'd just give oot to bring his work,
And have a smoke where Anna goes,
And go alone and come again,
For a ha'-pile of sticks to store,
And then he'd go through fry and grain
And bring him up his breakfast-tin.

He thought he'd take Anna to the city,
And then he thought that'd do,
And never brought her back again,
But sent her to good old Mary's farm
With a blessing for Ma and Mabel.

A chap named Winslow came to town,
(Maybe you've heard of him?)
No, he ventured to an ale-house,
And then you may have heard
He owned the tavern, and owned two dogs
For sowing his own food.

One night came Parson Jonassen
(You may have heard of him, too?)
In need of a parish not far distant,
Within whose walls were a cottage
(Very likely reason for a parson--)
And one very sick and feeble
Listed on the parish rolls.

And in it grew a beautiful tree,
Like the very best of schemes--
You'd take the green of it, and build a house
On its earth; and what's more, of steel!
And so they took Parson Jonassen.
He showed what care he had to charge,
And made his wife and her two dogs
Treat each other for dinner. Yes, he got--
What's that thing called again?--a chicken's head
First parlay: a flying chicken's head!

I thought the chicken would have been rude
To leave there with a lady's mess,
But so my love was made en route.
Thence I Gabriel up the Strand,
And bared its wings on MM
The day that Hats were set on MM.

And a man's eyes have many sights
In a lady's face, I know;
The cheeks, tho' they be closet white,
The highlights of love can mar,
If you so talk; and the jetigeonde,
From glossy to blush-de-Ment.

And, as age plays gentle Puck
And foul Folly, th' Ascraean woman
Is partial to the fair,
And to the nice, o'er half the globe,
For phloem of some kind;
And MM's mouth'miss, was never thick,
But condition new,
And a MMtovo there's now no doubt,
And the best friend of her fox.

Alas, Puck, shallow, grim and old,
Still in your sweater vesties rove,
Your whiskers' increase is Folly's Spiel,
As you grow more bold to flout;
Your skin your height, your figure's heavy,
For still you're wearing slops,
While certain climes, and some your peer,
Disclose as much Neptune's lust,
As what he by your simple tasks,
Implores your aid. And what's the end?
Against your head, and brow, and pride,
No charm now, and scarcely a sigh,
Dismissal and bile.

Away, away, Puck, child of wine,
Since not from thee I find a gleam of light,
Nor the best friend, nor helper, thorn-ward, thy sphere
All calm, and safe, beneath the moon,
Be it yours to point the next great crossing,
And not thyself to play!

"The Rain of Tit to the Sun's Rise", by Robert Frost [Living, Nature, Weather, Philosophy, Festivals, Christmas]
The night is very dark, and does not know how the sun is going to rise.
It does not know the answer to its prayer that is given in the name of their ancestors, or the rabbits and cats and dogs.
And so it goes.
Dead night knows the names
Of all the flowers and beasts in the world.
And so it is that the animals in the forest can tell
Where the birds that sing in the moon's face are going to be carried.
It is like a person going into sleep,
Where a dream can help with the stairs and waken the next day
With a cold and pain.
I do not know how long it is since I slept last
But it is a long time since I slept and even dreamed.
It was not my day and it is not my night.
I was not born then.
It was later and it is day and it is even darker than this night.
I am going to bed and I have been told to but I will not.
I have been too long about to be good and not grow in size.
If they are red and I have been said to be green,
If they are large and thin and I am not,
If I have been said to be and I am small,
If I do not know myself
What is my hour,
What the true shape of sleep to be,
What is night like and like day,
And how is the darkness said to be,
And what is daylight and how is the light?

"Death and the Animal Spirits", by James Lytt on DeathAnd a Tale of Illusion
The winter light has taken the leafy blackness with it. The bird cries and other sounds of motion have stopped. Yet the field still knows the smoothness of a bare tree and the youth's songs that continue through this slough of hope that they will follow after the rest.
A sound of iron has wandered from its hidden spawning pool.
There has been casting of off all this stuff in mounds.
It has gathered and been gathered in by more than the wisest, most tiny, spirits. The cities of men have kept them from ruin and more fail less.
The strength of this nation, its barest, lowest line,
Leaves more than the storm dream of shade and lightning.

"Lips", by Paul Laurence [The Body, Love, Realistic Wit]
Oû, po Fields of Hyssos

Lips are useful things,
You cannot make somebody else say it,
And so with mine

I have hoarded a secret
That will support me if I need it
Against the laid upon force of cloying atrocity,
And the coming of words that smear the groundtenbacks of place
In a vain attempt to cover you,
And the prolonged raising of arms to my chest,
And the sliding of hands from panel to panel
To panel to panel
In a night of lies.
I will lay my lips aside
In the dust of dead things
And bare my fingers that you may understand me
In the no meanest way I can conceive
With no embarrassment
That will oblige the strictest of characterisers
To hold my breath and pull my hair back
Until I have let my hair grow thick
And maintained this denial for as long as the rejectionistic dressing-down
In a building full of screaming children
That demands that we keep our cool
And free from emotion
In a marketplace full of implication and image
Where the empty atmosphere of the role
In a literal game of solitaire
Is used as a point of contact
With a threatening and incommensurate aggressive kind of intelligence
And I wear the flesh of the flesh that the war has taken me into.
Layers of the body that have lost round after roundabout struggle
To get breath in the right place at the right time
Are given new breathing and hungering after rounds
Because the body is a voice and the blood is a drop of blood
And the stories that it tells are never quite what it says
In the hapless code that it would have you believe
Because the past has left it with the bitter task of guiding
This wilful uncertainty
That holds me here in the passive, exhausted and exposed
So that I do not manage to put my best foot forward
Because the body is a voice and the blood is a drop of blood
And I know how it would have me there for now,
But I would also manage as good on the widest beaches
In my guide vocal body
Were it preserved in the right words
Because the body is a voice and the blood is a drop of blood
But I have not shown my most ordered and proportioned self
Because it has never been held captive in the right words
And I have not been to be treated as such
In the wearisome and poorly pointed fashion of the ways
Because it is only a fleshly voice
In the name of the dead past and its representatives
And I break the pattern that it has worn to piece together
In the modern days
But I am a participant in a fleshly voice
And the blood of the past in the blood of me living in the flesh
I have shown the night like steps to lead to the daylight
With steps of touch and words to translate some part of itself
Into the task of looking up at the sky
Where I am thought of fleshly imagery of air and light

.
The rain moves me because it is a voice and a fleshly thing
In the name of voices
And voices are flesh for they are outside
From the secure and well laid aside place
That is audible to the soul
They are outside in the senses
They wear the costume of bodies
They are among us and we follow and relate
How the crowd at the printing were moved
And held
And they understood
The moment that Holmes had shown Jones
Because she was outside in the name of the voices
In the name of the forms
Of the voices
The old hope that it is the voice of some one person
Who will break through the numbing Bates mold
And awaken all those stupefused by blindness and wealth

 through heaven;
But the wave would not wash it with its filth,
But the ripples they smeared it with!

To-day, at the noon of noon,
The word was whispered in the city,
And all the people came flocking from the farms
To the square of Jamacia,
And they rode all at once to the square of Jamacia,
And they stood all erect in the sunshine,
And they gazed all at the Lady of the Querrifolt
In her beautiful body.

And she showed them her white body,
The nation from the hill-girt city of Jamacia,
Show'd her white body to the view,
The lovely lady of the Querrifontine;
And her raine the while was all besmeared with streams of black,
And her locks down to the ears in mourning were,
And her legh this while was all sable in the sun;
For thus in the country the hunters travel,
So a while she appeared, with all black sickness

And as they were coming in, from out of a village,
A maiden cry'd out in the principal street,
'Oh father Jose, come you to save a skin,
And save a skin of my maguey too.
A serpent's egg of the serpent you picked up last year
Into the village, ate it and stuck it in your head,
But hopefully it told you of some great secret,
Which now I the moment that you picked up your skin,
This hiding of the serpent in men's skins.'

To the King the maiden cried, from his palace looking,
'There are still some great secret to discover,
Hidden in men's skins, which will certainly prevail;
And but in time the power of the serpent will expire,
And we shall know how to conquer it in men.'
And to that King of the red men, his white daughter
The white father, hasting to the King's banner, bore
A skin of the dirementsh, a maguey wame,
Of the rapids beautiful and mighty,
And this show'd, so bright and of so vengeous arace,
That in front of the rabble, beside the skin,
There ran suddenly, down the valley, an ague-stir
As of a well-wrought vehicle by a train of steam,
Steam-towels shoved from their bosom down,
The verwaine itch which, in over-charge, would-be gag,

As the fluttering gypsy tore at the limp-stranger's
Quivering, struggling skeleton, the King beholding
A face in the gleaming darkness glancing,
And saying, 'By God, be quick or it is imm all o' thee,
For of thy time it only forty four hours endeth becometh,
So haste thee now, or bate thee thou.'"

The tide and the flowing etherealness of heaven;
O God, why dost thou let the golden gates dayless spend,
And purse-proud Sol have his gates, barred, wide open,
To dazle all others, for his sacred time,
And guess'st not, O clever one, their depths perform?
Yet he who will find the valley-parts unbarred
By the heels of thy vain feet, his flight restrain,
Lest, tracking before him the barely disappearing rays,
After him also, flash the twofold shadows, blind.

'Tis the last of August, the sun with his beams
Like heavy sunspheres smiting the hillside,
In one moment
Shining
The sparry shawar,
And then the meadows,
And next the fields are cool,
In darkness.
So, with the dawn,
The muzcil, lovely, tired,
Starting from her repose,
Her robe is dripping, dripping, dripping,
On meathook silvery calm,
And I with wind for teeth
Break, in love,
Into her arms, and find her, quenchy tree.

How will I the night trouble,
In her dark body,
Who was so eager, so free,
On the toils of men walking, going?
But now, now that I have won my feet
To rest in her bosom,
The harder remains,
But now I know the nearer is,
To kiss her lips.

And who heareth?  Ah, my Omen of evil,
It is not to be known,
Lest the poppies from their fear
Not appear too hard,
Rock-crested mountains,
On fire fountains flowing fire.

ball;

such kindness I never saw;
For me, there was no magic, only a kind of
soreness,
Which I knew had a name of its own:  this world
I left behind.
I ran to tell her that I had a fright; she was
kind,
And said she'd go with me to look at the crane;
We went away, and I shut my letter
into a
little envelope, folded it and hid it
under my hat.

That night, when I was sitting on the
stair,
weary, dreaming,
I looked up in the child-labor camp across the
Bay,
and they were there with me.
I do not think they meant much harm -- at least,
they seemed quite happy.
I saw them coming,
as I turned in my bed,
and locked the door.

They were playing,
as I lay there dreaming,
to try to get the feeling of,
in some undefined
place, of how much weight
it is to love
a little baby or a grown baby.
I thought of this as I watched them: --
May I get that?
I got it -- and I left them
to go to the devil --
to the doughty DEERE --
whose wife had just thrown a pie at one,
and who understood the word
in the sense of DEERE.
He came to me and said:
Oh dear! did you open the door late?
I answered him,
I was asleep all day, and wanted to sleep.
I threw a pie at someone.

did he mean that?
He meant that, yes.
As in, the doughty DEERE had gone on from being
kind to kind.
He had been a mirror for me in dough,
for another in dough, and for myself,
and we had had a past that was sweet and hollow.
Now he was gone and we were two of our
selves,
and he and we were one.

I wanted to do the right thing,
and I tried to do it.
I picked up the pieces,
I took them home.
I laid them carefully in two lighted bedroom
tiles --
the light from my father's room,
down a blackboard,
and I put them in my pocket
down my coat.

I took a last look at my father,
then left the house.
I went away, and I headed down the street.
I looked left and right, and started to my house --
and I got there just as my wife was getting
cloath.
I listened, and heard her scream;
I returned -- and she was all right.
I stepped into the cockpit,
and saw the doughty DEERE bare-legged
ahead of me,
and my heart sank;
I backed up and stepped into the cockpit,
the same as the thousand others,
and started to reversing the car --
and all at once, the game was over;
I reversed it again,
and myself got the bug.

"I remember, I remember," I said,
"that time when we raced at night
in the butter-green Jeep.
I thought it was only a dream at the time,
but now it seems so plain.
Why won't he let me have a bath?"
I got into my bed,
and if that shouldn't have been a death
felt by a wall, I shouldn't have told my watch;
and if that shouldn't have been a death,
and why couldn't I have taken a shower,
and if that wasn't a wall, and if that shouldn't have been,
why, then, I was a god, and there was nothing I could do.
I tried to do a lot,
and what did that accomplish?
Nothing but a little passed.
Didn't anyone listen to me?
I tried to teach the world
What to do,
and how to do it,
and someone didn't do it,
and some did it wrong.
That wasn't my fault,
and it isn't mine,
but what else was I?
Didn't I give Death his nickels and dimes?
Didn't I give God his green?
And this arthritis too,
my long head,
my hirsute arms, my hairy belly --
did I tell the doctor I'd die someday
(I'd dreamed that, somehow)
and was I not poisoned?
I was passing of breath,
I was passing of life,
passed and passed.
I died of living,
and living I.
And God,
and the doctors,
and the pharmacy.

- I heard a howling!
I saw a beast's head:
A little brown hare lay dead;
A moaning gave it life.

The day was hot,
The water steaming,
I lifted my head,
And looked to the east,
To wash the dust from off the shore;
I looked to the south,
To what was nigh, I knew not,
To a seen far-stretched beach,
The cliff of which was glass.

The little boat steamed fast
With the sand from the shore.
I did not know what
Was left of the beach,
The cliff or aught else,
But the path was gone!

O restless daredevil,
You know how close to survival
The favour of that glorious sun,
The little gold-eyed pilot of my craft!
What right
Have I to presume to what your motives are,
And if you choose to declare yourself,
You'll say how my life was altered!

It was not as you left me
That I took up my quarters,
My fast-standing little girl;
But your little sail
Had held fast to the shore.
O happy days of old,
My fancies were packed off
In the honeyed wanderings
When we were newtzed ashore,
The boughs turned we dreadfully,
All our days were dry.

It was not as you left me,
That I made you untitle,
But having grown
A powerful little gentian
From bright dream to bright dream,
You feared the misty days were coming.

But the worst is o'er and done,
My fears were all yuper,
Your little boat sank to swamp,
Your little sea was sad.
We sat on the sand in our fixes,
And we lived to behold the beams.

And her adulterous lovers are to burn.
I will do him more than any;
And I 'll see his face again.

I have hunted with the houseless animals,
In dunes of sand, in lakes of putrid liquid darkness,
In the bowels of birds, in beasts with shame,
Or with men dupped, in discoveries new,
In fetid ponds, and filth, of chattering brutes;
I have popped the heads of children in one,
The head of mother, in one fetid pond,
In one scene a patrician's country 's one,
In vile America the area, where the rabble 's rabble;

And we 'll pop the heads of many women,
The females of all genders 's transitory,
For the right entrance to the ages below.
I have poked the most elfish eolus upward,
For the nobility of rustic women,
For the slight but showy trick of elevated brows,
For a pointed lilt of nose and upper lip,
For a skull with certain traits in measure,
And a bettered life I was after.

Now I know they are true, the women,
For I have pocked the little lady's 'bust'!
For I saunted up her stick and egg,
And I can give three shits on the nigguish whim!
And I haf some 'ean, and ony three,

HOLD out your hands,
Open the windows of the heart;
If the hands are wet
, the window is not wash'd;
Open them,
Shut them,
Think not of the trouble;
What you have done,
Take away,
And to-morrow will have done.

RADHA TWAWS of the South,
This burnt child is not for you.
Myself am wet; myself am I.
No one will wipe me;
Mere sunshine will not douse me;
I am a glow-stone too.

My heart leaps up when you look,
My heart leaps down when you set;
My heart goes out for your regret,
My heart goes out for your tears.
O brave, O hard,
O futile boy!

This side of the suns,
This side of love,
This side of the gods,
I am a spark,
I am a glow-stone.

As one who before his tent shines
The freshness of a cold flame
That fans the bones that have been chill'd,
By spreading warming; thus was I,
Before I, before I knew not
My own warmth to be my chiefest part.
And like a hollow I were hollow,
And as a glowing to a drop.

To-day the water-sponge, who otherwise
Hath lost his present seal, his future one,
Prepares another where he likes it,
Loosens from false gourd the leaves that wave
And lifts them off, to spread them widely,
So far as they can, unto the people;
And so far as they can they.

And as some rich man in the rich man's castle
Finds at his casement, in pyramids of glass
Of jealous transparency, lady's eyes,
And feels them lovely; so the people, while they stand
In magnificently ordered manners, begin.
The mighty man himself to-day in rank is seen,
Clad in a humble coat, that loosely concealed
His mind, and trying, like all youthful masters,
To strut in a witty sensuous way.

At last he throws down the mask, and all is seen;
His arrogance, and his neglect, and his desires.
What is the result? Why, I suppose, this:
That he, whom I thought so superior to be,
Can'trun with out warrants of any merit!
Not being able makes him scarce worth knowing.
And my poor quill you may without impropriety
Clap among the brillant mountains which I showed
Here in the presence of another Jove,
Which, like great buckles, resist the fulness of thunder,
Possessed of snow before an audience.

Fool! If you are not rather alone,
Alone before whom my gaping spirit resents
The void and impossibility of a reason,
The ghost of mystery and the star of bewitchment!
(What the antiquarians call the sunset, I call the dawn,
For both these words were coined by man canards.)

In the presence of other Joves, and those again upon their summits,
I have behelds the earth inclos'd and the four-mile circle taken by surprise.
Each eye, refrang'd upon the mids from an infinite skyscape,
Smokes in the center, who will some time reflect the soul of a god.

For all is carelessness, and all wassail of an unbeholden heaven.
How the smoke, that from the chair of the unlucky o'er-seas is dauntless, External,
Reflects him, and how the most trivial thing--the shadow which ascends and is parted
As it dallanders, to the outer psychic world,

O Jesus Ultrasonic my voice is torn and rasping,
O compassionate antitheseReply on to that, all thatSecure thee and save thee,Be an eternal prism that engages his world.
Eyes, hearers and men, that find in the cordial planet their pole,
Pour forth their reflections, and the planets, round which their will inclinere,
Tend to be receding with the orbit of their feet.

Most unco merry, now.
I wish I were as good
And as clever as Barney the goat,

I am sure he's very sombre, but that's fair
With all the time of day and night,
He never shares it a jot.
I wish I were a pale or series kind of dark,
But that's as ill-bred, too, to be clear,
And so I wish I were shrink-headed grim

When the dishes were all cleaned and the leftovers eaten,
The five-o'-clock, the head-chef and his gang,
Came up to take a last slurp at the dinner-bell.

I wish I were living for the sport that he played,

They marched two of my chum, Cap 'N' Man, on the dusty ground
To the sepulchre under the madefor'heartbroken trees.
But I'm more and more in your heart and my eyes
Loved you more than men or cattle or sheep or pigs or birds.

"The Beggs", by Edward Thomas [Love, Break-ups & Vexed Love, Infatuation, Nature, Fall, Gardening]
The bargs who are not too lovely to be fattened for the pillows,
Who have no thoughts of their supper to think as they eat it,
Who have no Thought of you to mind their penitents,

Who have no Channells through their fingers to point them anywhere
Hereafter, who have no bloodsheds through their veins to rain as sort of a pond-water
In the world, but only sort of garden-air, now and then,

And who are eating their hearts out, with no stomach's permission,
Are The Beggs.
They have been fattening by their bosoms, and they have been starving their hearts,
They have been looking with their knees and they have been shaking with their knees,

And they think there is no banqueting, though they may be wearing a ragged coat,
No question of a dinner and no marriage, unless of a table, no doubt,

No trouble about their hearts to beguile, if they have any sense at all
To stay at home and cook for nobody, if they have any knees;
They think there is no tavernening, though they sit long and slopping in their blood,

No little drunk about their drunkenness to stir the ashes with shocked hair,
No hobbling, though they go single, to tie the shambles with no pants

And make as mix as they can of the shambling and the tumbling with no minds;
They think, though, that this is all, and this is all they must expect,
No matter how often they have paid the Fee, there has never yet been a Meeting,

No Chairs, and no Members, but they call in their own representatives,
The Insignificant Seal-Kings say the contained and the perplexed ones sit there,

Pouring the substance out, pouring it through holes and not making holes at all,
Making a substance out of a burst that will not hold and wrapping it in CLASSIC tables,
Hambling therefor, rubbing their hands and saying (says the blood, it is BOMBING their shitty long underground):

And my own mother saw it and would say something along the lines of, "We are the offspring of a woman and God," but I don't know what she would have done about it. I was one of those children who are just too attractive for their own good, a chubby mama's boy, the kind of bantam body that was just too smooth and good for someone to ever feel secure in. I was chubby, but the way I dress up the whole body is just so much sleeve-wear. So maybe he was just after enjoyment, I don't know. Maybe he was just being a lover.

"from The Fatalist Book of the Skies", by Marilyn Nelson [Living, Death, Growing Old, Life Choices, The Body, Time & Brevity, Nature, Summer, Arts & Sciences, Poetry & Poets, Social Commentaries, Cities & Urban Life]
In the city, the dark and dying green of night's exit becomes more vivid against the black of the sky, which in turn gives way to the grid of asphalt which hides the death. As a sheet off a bail, or an exit screen, a route books itself and becomes the story of driving itself. From Grid to Grid. From Drive to Dash. Into drive, from room to room, landing not in the best-laid schemes of someone's journey, but somewhere in the jigsaw puzzle of someone else's life. Driv'n, stnv'red, at stnv'red. The hardest choice: not to walk, though. Choose your mistakes. The hardest choice is to change. The man with blue hair decides to stop drinking, whispers to his three best friends that he is going to change, and he does. Says he is going to start researching ancient Greek poetry. Unconfirmed: his friend replies: "Okay, yes." A breath: the answer to his research. His wife, exhausted from looking after him, tumbles off the cliff edge with: "I saw a man half over here who looked like Edmund Hillary." A rope: a friend who says he is changing, or a rope is handed to him. Halfway up: a friend who says he isn't sure. Outside the city: starling's feathers, which a worker wraps in wet cloth, then hangs for meat. He sees her from the bus, climbing teardrops, his improvement upon the pluperfect point into darkness, into deadening. To maintain his vigour, to outlive his mortality, to become a kind of metronome, to remain stable as days, to remain stable as nights, to remain stable at night, to remain whole, to become five years ago. To an Ektacharid's mental beak: a kind of mental dove. The waxing moon is already another city. Greycliff is firelit in a cold year, he is thick as a sun, and his smoke is white. He writes like that. A months' work are a poet's pages. The watch in the pink marble face is a finger pointing somewhere south of electrical lightning, the motto of Fiorillo's. The watch's a ma'am, his life are his facts, the crystal heart a fey dream. No. One day he rolls up the watch and swallows it package-wise in a gilt puff, exhaling the bejewelled bub. Clings to it dearly, his fingers smeared with red, the year's knot in his fingers bruising the coin-sized square. A parcel hinged in a gilt puff.

The grand full moon upon her dun wame dun wame.']

In the lowest woods of Enginedges, or new-born
Deep ones, together stealthily,--
Spreading their wide stealthily operant body
Through the leaves, leaves outspread!

As our birds do,--with their compick legs and flit
Them wide stealthily along,
So our best girls, outhidden in Enginedges,
Lovely with the edges of that wood.

--But their bodies have the glory of Enginedges:
Their thighs the paddles of the horses and engines,
And dew-drops the boots of that night's march.

--Yet their bodies have the beauty of the forests,
With the edge in the borer of groves,
And the shade in the borer of trees.

The borer of trees, and the hobnail-lite:
But it ends now, my dainties: thee, my pen.
The pen! my pen! my first essay, my first fling,
From the sill of my authorit'-bel targe,
To warn thee: don't look in it.

--Whose beauties' word its weight knows nothing of.
My pen's page is but half-lighted: there, I wait

That sees what the life-mind was never able to see,
In the vast and culminating sum of its conclusions.

'But it ends now, my dainties, for thee I'm now undone;

I'll write--I have done it--and again I'll write,
And the country will thank me.
But I've now to resume my foolscap portrait,
In a sort of way, of my first triumphs over fancy:
I now have nature in authorit, and I know
What the people liveliest are to think of at any time.

But I see now, of the press what when it was, and why:
The loud, eager, intoxicated clamour of expectations.
They were held by a mere hoax on a masseur's part:

As a kind of prose poem to feed hungry prose brains.

 And, even after death, still every night
She walks in me.  I am her husband, her lord,
And servant equally.  My life and death,
Her life and death, are one.

I am the house.  The house is me.
The house and I were one
From the very beginning.  The first room
I furnished was her bedroom.  My clothes
Dropped like shells from the roof of the house,
Were sometimes a burden
For her, who, when clothed by me,
Were less than hot and sparkling things.  And
I gave her something, perhaps I did not know
As I brushed her sleeve so swiftly and flew
By mouth and eyeballs, for so the buzzing flies
Are burdens for some miserable woman's hands.
I made the bed for her.  We used the same sink.
Both our sinks are empties.  The same shoes fill
The tumblers, and the paper comes groomed
For both.  We speak, we love, we edit each other
Oblig'd.  There is nothing alike in all that.

She talks me down, I see.
O, the war, the peace
Of lovers' hearts under the shield of resisting the shield!
Is it beloved or afraid?  O, shrill and strong,
Faster, fill my cool and wet fins against her legs!
Love, love, your end is astley.  O, brown and soft and sweet!
Her lovely body came I want'd; it must go by
At the command of some voice I cannot see,
Or by the slow attrition of my years.  O, form'd
Out of some reluctant seed,
Some responsive to my making, and all serviceable,
My pleasing load outsweeps me.  I answer the mass
With solemn swelling melody.

Sweetness!  I could swear
That such the noise my eager and intently coming tongue
Would vainly speak,
If those unheeding and untimely times should hear.
Swifter and louder I arise,
And so much louder, fly about the trees and seek
To learn the secret bench,
And in the quiet of the calm,
The secrets of the dark branches learn.
O, more than sound sweet!
Better than rhythm and silence, clearer than tune
And prayer and Mass and prayers, as certain are my rhymes.

My life is a question
Right now unto your two ears,
Right now for this great world,
Right now for all the people!
There are no other times
Or other people, to be wagers
Of what I say.

If you be true,
If you be true,
Let us thoroughly soak our skin in
The cup and we guess
If this is truth!
If it is,
Let us but tuck
Each other's hand
Left shoulder forward,
And bursting there
In joyous good-bye to
The grave.

If you be false,
If you be false,
To the touch we will have
Conflation, conversion,
Right quickly.
If you be false,
Right away
Let's have you out of line,
For I shall lie
And you shalt be
All the Devil!

All of them together now!--
All of them together now!
Alive and dead and warm
And dead and warm!
O what a hot and cool!

All of them together
All of them together now!
All of them together now!
All of them together now!
All of them together now!
All of them together now!

Here we were some time and long,
Here we are again
Two or three weeks and two days.
Two or three weeks standing here cool,
As if we should have been friends,
In some'aticulous spot,
Some residence for a while done.
This I have learned in my new place.

Now the years take the hangings down,
And upon the steps defer
Casual Confidences.  How hard
It is, a new life like a stock,
To know too much, indeed too much!
Here we were some time and long,
Here we are again two or three weeks.

And yet it is not very far,
In the next street to Gloriana's apartments;
And, doing those ten's, ten's, ten's in it,
Ten steps, ten steps to go in;
Enough, in the size, to understand
How little it matters, when with one,
As I have just been told,
One is automatically,
In the next building,
Alive, in all details but one.

After supper
It was lovely to know
That the child was not averse
To some slight mirth or mirth
To go in at the gates of Fate.

He left his work, he said,
To fit the word
And lived with it
In his mind till it brayed,
And then drew a circle
That the world must fill

And then he set
In his mind
The letters of the alphabet
And what the letters were
And how they all fitted one another.

And some of them worked and some
Did not
And some of them were a pain
And some of them were a gift.

He could say "Yes" and "No"
To the most boisterous of bores.
He could laugh as he pleased
And break a glass upon
And cuff a smiling smile
And he could covet a book upon.

At his pen
The ore was piled, the lav was poured
And the different grains flew every way.

And then it came to him
As he rode to the forge in the lane
A suspicion that he might be right.

The first word that he said
Did as express
What the next word did and the next.

The copper turned and the knives flew,
And then a smoke
Was seen to lift
A bit of the hill, and let fall
A rain of little leaves.

And it was followed
By a line
That was all of a colour.
It could be none of them,
For it didn't make any;
And yet they chased the tower,
And they didn't understand.

And the three men that were kings

Called the judges in,
Because they feared the stone;
And then,
Without saying a word,
They locked the door.

And then they shivered and fidgeted,
And some of them laughed,
And some of them wept with frustration,
And some of them shivered till they wrenched,
And some of them cursed the night,
And the summer that came before,
And held out despite of it.

The sun that saw them
Ceased dreaming about the day,
And the tower shook with their mutiny.
The sun that is on
The earth today
Was in his lamp dreaming dreams
Of happier climates, and new lands.

And the rooks that were on the heights
Killed with heat and thunder,
Let go of their boastful step and raise
Their wings and mount the gray and dusty things.
And they died because they lived in hope,
Because they had no thirst for treasure

But now,
But now,
I know that the water that drips in pools
Is not more Pacific than the sea
That weeps and blows in these succourless arms.
I know that the winds that beat so close
To the fever and the tear
Are just as haunted as the palms
That smoke in the sun
And blink black night.

But the sea is not Pacific,
The island is not mine,
And the dead that sleep beyond the sun
Are not mine, Guernsey is the gate
To a wider bound around the world
That no man knows, and none may know
Until Heaven invents again

A crown for Rhene, a gilded crown on Rhene
Whose sands are turned, and sung unto by the shoot
That reveals the ancient shore to a summer party:
We are all tourists to Pacific, history
Turned to lamp-light, and the luxury of laurel
The luxury of invisible things.

We are all tourists to Pacific, I claim
A bigger name than yours, and I am more happy,

The Greeks were the first people to see the Pacific
And your ships they held the honour of anywhere.
There is nothing American about me save
The trace of a American in my strong, dark head of hair
It suits you so, Pat O'Brien's head on the cover of
The New Yorker or New Yorker magazine.
And I own that I am the Thrasher, the first woman to
Edit it.

I claim I have the name of an empire to myself
In some sense final and greatest island that is sown
Annihilator idea for peoples of partiers,
The name of an Atlantic port where a dog
Has a swimmer to stay who may choose to live
For a larger form of subjection than
The smallest point of man's empire may hold,
The smallest vine in the widest space of air,
The smallest span of escalade.

I can trace my name to the start of empires,
Though I am thought to be the children of time
Because I am an emanation of the earth,
My lineage older than the furthest

Which, when he ne'er had,
His books have once rendered dense,
The man of genius, or the man of fact.

Which and no other; he's
Gifted by Nature all,
All pure and causeless powers,
Has a sense t' excell in thought,
A wit both sharp and sweet,
A war of minds, whereinto one's pitted.

For when a man is struck,
In pleasure's sooth endeavor,
With so much power, so much touchstone steel,
Falls down upon pleasure, like onestouckction!
I know not what's like, but what is unsounds,

The worst is like the best.
If one stirs from the place
In which he's stultified,
If one strives to get from his nature
A Greater Nothing, Perversity
Differs the will from all its parts,

The strongest reason, and the second best,
Are like baby hands, which can reach and touch,
And they're supposed to be.
If one, intent to greatness, would pry
Between that and what is like the nad of
His wisdom's pearl;
That is, betwixt the two highest powers

As now employed in the nad, between those
That never ceased to and that which is never
Poked into what it never was nor to:
Between the nad and now of all his actions,
His past, present, future, thought, or work.

Come, what the world of wisdom is, is't not
To stop a little at the right place, to the ring?
To bring together what is good in each, and spray
Off each, round the fount of the stomach?
That's plenty; but let every one know, he hits
The mark no more, than if 'twas a sword-blade more
cut, or bottom from the horse's toe, or break.

"They bathed him they brought to bed.  And now?"--
"They tied him to his bed."--"Where is he?"
"Downstairs, in a wagon, with a dog.
That spoke, the room heard what he said."
"Say, what is the sex of the dog?"
"The dog's sex can't be."--"Hitch'd is he?"
"Hitch'd or held, if you're going to go
Where I should think not, you must talk."

What is the good man doing
To any earthly court below?
His heart's divine, but--only let me live on.
He radiates goodness round, and, so locked as I am
With the true idea of it, I'll not intrude
On another's space to kneel down and fan my face
With its own smoke: no other brute can do so
With such a concentration.  Think of it!
(Bride of Fire! burn in me)! no pain, no regret!

Or, if any thing looks lantern-jawed and self
With its own existence, 'tis the more
Exhibited to the sun's total malison.
A good man must have that taste; what good?--throwing wedges,
Or guarding a lamp: and first present to his flame
Should his door be, as it thick halts at noon:--

What is the good use of man?.  It is, to each
Generation after generation, in each land,
To keep the spirit of freedom pulsing, piping,
Pouring love and worship pure above the wave:
Just so present in all earth's departments--
Cows, hogs, tigers, lions, wild-fowl, and man:
Not to say aught of the creatures of other kinds,
But such notice should concentrated be there,
As man sufferests seldom to assert his freedom.--
And, now as I'm a Protestant and go
By what I've gleaned from this moderate study,
It is to boys indisputable as brothers,
That this old fool
Came forth so boldly, by such brethren inspired.

All men are decent and well to-day,
Fathers and brothers; they know their God,
Never was the mean written stain
Of what our earth made horrid pricker before.--
Well, our quotations I can barely supply,
Self-publishing from the mouth of Washbourne--
But there's a mountain drive
Coming on in Delaware, and then we'll see
If the Great One will permit us to stop at Louis

If there's a God.
I believe the parties grow excitable,
Hard to be settled, close coming to the event:
At this price the Democrats can but stumble on
The old confounded tariff, which causes offence

Oh, so slow to grieve,
And so willing to forget.

Because you loved me
Too well for love to dull,
Made me far too glad of old,
A smile too much unkind.
Then I praised you too much,
Expected too much of you.
You did not feel that then,
Nor know.

I loved you
In the days that are nigh.
Summer sunbeams fell upon your hair,
Cooled your kisses with the air,
Praised and caressed you
Full of sweet wish-nursing.
I tried to hold you close,
Did not always practice well.
I made you endless sport,
You wanted to kiss me at first
Half angry, half terrified.
I was glad, I said: why not?
Loving half-felt desire,
Half a woman, half a bird,
Half an evening on the lawn.

I did not know
How deeply, how proudly
That would be loved to say:
"I knew at last I knew you then,
I told you so in all the weather,
In paragraphs, images flew,
I broke from head, arm, and legs,
Plunged underwater alone
Till saw a wren–you know what I thought
That day we vowed in Spring–
Me, a lily of the Stream–
Paid a gay orange-red,
Wren, meek orange blossom;
Wren, meek orange blossom,
Mixed their Tongues up and down,
Half and half, till the whole wood looked
Ragged in a ruffled way.
You know what happened.
And I thought you knew
Only to kiss me there and now,
And for cool thoughts that passed by.
Aqualung, my man Riedgraber,
Our childless childhood came to do
Sitting on the river's edge
Blowing through bircheres–all of us
With a wish to break their heart of gold,
For we knew of a magic that breathed.
But it didn't.
And I am broken in heart,
Bitter and irreparable harm
Has come to me today.
My dear, how you don't!
And a great sister you do.
A snowy Queen sat crowned.
And a snow white Camel walked on a hill.
And the Camel smiled, and Camel kind
Smiled, but the white Queen rode on.
Then the snow white Queen bent down,
Took the glittering golden Key of England,
And put it in her breast.
And she fell from her throne.
But it didn't.

And I am going to the ends of the earth
Finding things to complain about,
You have brought me happiness, and made me proud.
And I shall not be sad, you will see.
The Ends, I shall call them, I am going to bring about.
But they'll never make you laughter orhappy.

I must be true.
And when I say, "I," do not think that this
Means that everything I say is true. Far from it.
That it is safe to bring all hopes and all worries up
For Lady to trust what I say, that's not so easy.
Only not sad.
And when I say "I," don't think that he says "me too"
I can imagine many marvelous worlds not black.
And when he says, "I," do not think I'm hovering
Till he replies, "Me only," or "Me too."
What does it do
To know that I must be true, and you do too much true, to you.
To me, "truth" means much more
Than when you do know that it is evening and morning.

water the first she moves on a river.
But as I learn, you always stand
with your fists locked, and with your back to
the same kind of water. And that, too, is already done.
Your body is locked in a cage of trees, you see,
it is a cage of trees, and not only
the copperwoods it is also the and a field of
blackbird and widow, and also of course the
bougainmayatan and the jacquhavin.
The cage is so that you can't
in any way of what you see
except at the end your bare throat
and hands of feet and arms of your
feet, your hands of your body, your teeth of
your teeth, your mouth, your ears.
That's what the cage is for: it is there
to prevent you from ever again becoming
you else, the way you are now, without
a cage.
You yourself go on becoming
sometimes: sometimes you are the
bird wandering from tree to tree,
sometimes the dog running in front of you,
sometimes a human being, alone.
And each of these yourself knows the
number for the key of your cage. And
each one of these himself knows also
the number of the cage, so he can
find you in the end in the same way
you find each other and when he finds
you he feels he does not want to turn
round. And the cage is made of
metal, and each of these himself knows the
number of the cage on your body, so
he can find you in the end. And so he
can compare himself to others: once he
felt the cold in the hands and legs, and then
the hunger. So the cage is made of iron
because of their fear of obesity.
But if you examine yourself closely, if you stand
you will see the whole structure:
the cage, the iron, the cage.

"the boy with the turtle-neck", by John Skelton [Love, Relationships, Nature, Landscapes & Pastorals, Seas,  Rivers,  & Streams]
in memory of Margaret Hunt Atkinson

Forgive me every transformation of you in my favour
giving its own red will-os into pale death
for the green of your body to match

My will is not your affair. Your own worst
blame not yourself for not remembering
that first cold Sunday after your cool retreat
And as you sat at the table your companion
Stared at you and did not say a thing
You had a woman's clear eye and whether she knew
It meant all that mattered. Or your sister,
Fair as the risen Christ and just:
the daintiest of all your servants, and how exCIess
What are the westland chasing so far away
The neck of my father, a man long dead.
But forgive me not all the mourning you have worn
Nor the snow's silence speaking all the word
You who are wounded twice and I alone
Who have seen now where you lie and I may lie
This black, rugged pond in the eastern winter
Under the willows know if our fires speak
Once and for all if we have lived or died:
As Lamb opened first God into flesh
Once for all what can I say: I love you
For what, the old stories sayetrable
As now is the unknown we were long taught
Will be the unknown when the spring time has ended

God help us the end is in the calling

You said,
But we were just a flash
What is the sense of that
Why is it I can't remember
Who are these people
Do I hear
The Christmas clang today
Money just floated into your head
Come now look
How fine it will be
Lighting itself upon the darkness
This one little blink
Clang of old morning
Things that might have belonged to you
Once thought surely still do
One blink
This reminds me of everywhere
Only being once
Go light yourself
Remember what
Not a few paces down the road
I remember it all day
And then – the journey
And then – the losing
And then – blushing
Money won't buy me
Go live it

You cannot remain;
Don't you see how
======================================== SAMPLE 230 ========================================

Mun incognit sua petit! I who once was clean
Am filthy, the soul on earth. O grace,
I am still the same! Once let me eat,
And I am worth a pound. I am the same
As ever, and yet—Humbly be it said—
How strange is my fall!

I wonder if your God,
Who all this while be decrepid in state,
Who watch him in the boy, and tend him there,
Passed then his hands down gently, and said: 'Now
These, as blessed depend upon me!'
And as he cast his gaze upon the child
And saw him idling there, the smiling God
Call'd to himself in no malicious heart:
'Will stop, I need some one; for what has he
At which to cavil? Will I not have
My grandchild on my side again? He brought
Absurd ideas into the mind;
These will I relume and push into practice,
For that will I, so that he shall not relish
My presence; yet him I must retain.
Let him remain; that this may open passage
The hidden eye may find, let him remain!
That I may stand as he stands now, nor ever
The appetite be chas'd, merely in haveing to be.

Very well! then he must remain!
And I will endeavor to evoke affection,
I will attempt to stir youthful attachment.
I'll try to raise a lustre in your bosom,
That by delusion we have lost,
By the simple means of me, to you, and me;
So, as I present myself to you, in truth,
By the voice of affection, sweet and silent;
Now by effort, and by force of will,
We will by love be joined, before I shall yet
Be conscious of the motion.

(Soo-tonic was just bid to be gone,
Return'd the momentISH-TOO-TOO,
Wond'ring what charm could make him come back.
How shall the Soother set up a side,
With a charming tale, on his old breast?
And Soo-tonic said,Quasi-Final, almost made up of love:
O 'twas a crime to make him wait on me:
'Twas a crime to be so happy with her!

It was a sin to make him dependent,
And he placed himself with Ellen BPU-RL
As upon these terms: LB-PFL brought his costs,
A married woman, with what was just due,
A really excellent man, that day,
Who could, with little rhetoric, convince
This conscientious woman, till he married her;
Who, as for advantages, must have shrunk,
In her judgment, the face of the planet,
To the less than nothing woman, LB-PFL.

How shall he persuade her he loves
To do what to him seems so hard?
There is need to ask the very world between
To the making of words, since fit the scene
This engrosses him, like a fruit-dying vine.
The Soother sits with piteous stare,
Till Oo-ber not AG-ber was found hard by.
Pleased with this progress, thus she starts a tale:
A story is a simple tale made plain.

A great advantage Oo-trin based
Upon her little toy, is, she said,
A world of very little characters,
Which could be said by very little children,
Who thrice kiss their little Father Merival
With no desire to know him better;
Also we children love to fool our sires.

And, with this little secret knowledge,
The Soother had a feeling of all where head-talk
Is concerned; and, with it, all hostility
Betw. light and glory took for proof
The Soother's own feeling was of no covert
From this slight matter between her and her;
Which was a fact of serious consequences

Her own superior right to his;
His being, in the Soother's eyes, so much more
Than her delight and glory; and, more than all,
The sight, and feeling, and sentiment of his form,
And even wayward docelike countenance
To hers, since when, alas! they had been left
In blight of equal point of some kind:
Theirs still was most sex little, though;
Which heiss pleas'd o'er-composingly.

And from that new-lit system,
From silence, that our feet pass by.

The sleeping lanes, all happy with their peace,
That know not of the firing line,
The whispering stream where the rose-flood overflows,
For very gurgle with joy their lips;
The spreading laurel braids, that o'er the way
Wain the silvery golden thought,
And for the brier-rose and the ash-lipped springs,
Oh, the sweet whispering power of lot.

Oh, fields of white willows, where in warm summer dusk
The sun time's perfume can and will expand;
O dreaming birds, that far ere the gloaming expire,
Dreaming of the spring's reversion, calm and still!
With the warm flower, the wet benion, and the green
Shining face, and lily breast of beauty close union,
As promiser, or preserver of the sprout;
Oh, sweet quality of spirit-to-give and gi-
To-promiser, hey ho!
To-do-desire, do do! want, do, doesn't exist.
Oh, you dear galley-slaves, O dream for a space
Of the free river, and the word from the free mouth,
Then wilt find your glad passage furled
By some typhoon, black-hearted and against you,
Foaming in the deep that is crazed and hurrying,
Tortured with hurricane and wind of the sea;
Where the last bond is lemons, and the first bulging
One sack for which all fate doom is fixed,--
Anchor, lo! that shakes the tower for all below,
Ahead a crack; the waves leap sheer for beams that break,
Theroppie, shouts of the sirens to the roister
Down where the singed snow-crags shine free.

But we--we farier souls--crouch down
Under the snow-crag, where the light flutes,
And cumber our thoughts with the solemn snore;
Climb light as a fall, or toil and luxurie
For a fancied product of dew; for it
Was but the dew that slept last night on
Your jackets and hair; but to sleep, O cosey
Yourselves you poppy-breast'd comrades, though
Kind are you, revere us in your way
Breeze-soft, flower-sweet, rather dry,
But your ZODIAC leaps into view,
The tchotchikeren of Bacchic lust;
None for the flame, of fire is in your locks,
None for the flamethwith of it, no,
It scathes into drops the ruby sweat,
And your sides are of the dripping cypress;
The lice are trapped with hot hands on your skin,
And the bitter stinger with its burn
Is fitly mad on your very forehead,
The little men scream to spray on your cheek,
And the quadropede stench plays with your breath,
The octopi weep for the blubber'd side,
The crocodile wriggles from foot to foot,
And the green crocodile mewls to the death;
Then though you slash and crush it into dust,
Yet its monicry--its monicism--
Lies never on your thIRTLE BENCH;
But that small thick gaunt end whereof they sing,
With its glory and weight of honey and gold
Is HIAW, the hoarse-tongued lust,
Hiat no with hoosing of exertion,
But still with hiatusal a-punch and noose,
All out of gear, like a curmudgeon;
Like an ice-steel steady, or a steel blade
Rebellious; all the virtues of whichever,
Are bended as with ink in a quaker,
But never any, nor percutiaton
Of pracice, but a-punching and unpunch,
Lest in pursuing what the thing begun,
The strangled fleece should come to stabbing and
The miscreant be beguiled away.

Bruised with the memory of days not his own,

Is ashamed to beg for gold in the market-place,

Is trod upon by the young, the old by me.

I have been glad on Sechser's grave since

The war-cloud broke above me. I have seen the worst

And lightest of days lovelier than our time brings.

Some say the sun will scorch the houseless trees of Italy,


Some, the blue sky of the south and Arno's depths.

With buyer's remorse I take the time to weep,

Nor count my gains when selling anew at British Interest.

Lord, for the soul to know what we would be,

How much lacerated by debt, what wild rides,

On whatdeprived beaches, on what stranded boats,

I would rest as much of soul as body,

Lest when alone, the distance seemed so far,

Yet the solitude was not for us afar;

When the watch-light swam through, when the wave was deep,

When the song-tradition had not run

All of itself, we had so much to do.

When the world was on our shoulder, did we hear

The dumb things talk in their manifest sleep,

And did we see the God-search and the Wit

Of the twanging tree? We saw the blinding flood

Which drowned our solace in the sleepless night,

And through the dimness we saw the fire

Improve, and took in the swells and screeches.

I, who saw once forests felled and cast off

To build another world, think it was sweet

To bear on our suffering with no help

But the great blank of blank toil and vision.

In the dark my longing for the touch

Of his throat went up to the blood and spattered skin

Of his last lonely night on the climbey
Of the mountaineer, whose bow was still his friend;

Whose shooting got him nought but an alarum

At Charing. Would he be niggah to suck

The other twi* gus, syne that shot him blind,

And guss how I spit a load in his face!

But when the close was come I heard him huff

Spatter and foam, and felt the bladder brim,

And, "Now, man!" he shook his head and cried,

"I've bled enough, let's have a nice big blay!"
"No, don't brag," I replied, "by dam, hog,

You've lived," and went on to explain
How the muck and the mud and the water

Mixed my belt and had me horseshopped,

Till I felt delirious with the hoop,
And so swelled another for a share;
And, when I found that the brim it did char

The more it expanded, I arranged

To purchase a pair of dark eyes,
Peaches on the chin, and no hooly,

But a cap that had formerly contained brown,
And no ladies are the probly;
So I'm a barber and not a hooper,

With hoopers after my style,
As the water came in quick-shots,
On the curmurring wave; but that you
May read your colloquia in dark.

And I did once have cause to rue,
What week he called (last at hand), to "attend
A rubber at the Patrician ….

There may have been much to dislike

But … the nothing for an answer ….

That old and infirm quadroeme
Came to the usurped cinema
Of dead and lame to gaze and mistorme
On pity and tears, and last of all

The weepers. Well, he was bound to get her,

Without fail, or maker not being there,

So there was her pair of glasses made

For the Pants Treasury to tempt the market;

And never did devil, so astir,
But a percussion shimmy or hollow sound

Divine, transmuted into music;

And she to snatch him from the titchen
Of her imperilled patrimony,

And ride with the devil, and leave all

The world worse than it found him, before.

Then I taught my younger years his name,

(His only) of my own possession.

 whose name is the thing to make
Your hair stand on end, so it shall be an example
Of death, from which you learn to die.

"What!" they'll say, "if by the side-fire
Of a million deaths we-Suppose-begotten,
By a million dreams the father-Fish
Drowned in a mantle of brine?
What "thoughts" do we to satisfy
Your intellectual thirst?

"Our first-chancers, our "baby-daddies,
Our beautiful mother-hells,
We scarce can count our preferred
Countries of interest,
But what there is to-represent
You, doubtless, will not love.

"The University, a sort of Fish-cat
Played by an orchestra,
Now looks in the players' 'faces'
Ere they've gone the Moodyground,
For something meant to go right.
But they who have seen what we are
Sick from the taste of your graces

What you see in their 'features,'
What you say in your 'ways,'

To find the 'bulk' in the 'breast'
(He puts his finger here that.)
The 'bulk' goes the hard way round,
And not directly down.
'Breasts' are like a shell that a man
Could butt at just now.

'Tasting' is a bad thing.
'Tasting' is a bad thing.
As bad as every other 'thing.'
The 'Breast' gives a hard time
To a whole brood of 'Breasts'

You were saying just now,
That as far as you could go,
You 'ad nothing to do,
And no one to blame but Charles Dickens
Who never proved what he said
But as to the belles he gave
His meaning, nothing but
The 'bulk' they were, the 'breasts'
Were all they had been able
To get for their money.

And that, as much as anything,
Is what you are waiting for,
And if any 'thing' happens to
Stuff your mind with 'nothing' or
' Nothing 'plus Times.'

'Something' is not given men a head
For patience to endure,
'Something' is a strange name
That, with an easy mouth,
Renders you give up at once
With 'Nothing,' a word
That cries in an echo huge.

'Something' is not something at all
But a justifiable word;
'Something' is the child of nothing
That a man meets when alone
And 'Something' is a man's testimony
That has to do with 't.

'Something' is what you are thinking of
Or thinking that others are thinking of
And (what's the worst) 'Something' is to be
Thought of at all.
'Something' is a thing of no common kind
But an adjurious one
Yet, as I said, the 'Something'
The far-seeing something
Afforded by God,
Though fetter'd, as it matters little
To pronounce it well.

And, as for the heart, a troublesome thing
You'll get after finding;
Yet, as it matters little (Lin Blease!)
The 'damn' is, after all, but little
When 'Something' is thinking of something
But rarely, far more little.

You are not thinking of me, I say?
You know, as well as I,
That I am not speaking to you
As a dog's bark may speak.
You may go on, quite rightly, so far
And hard in your own conceit,
But not to him I call,
Or he'll find you are absolutely wrong
Or no place stops that.

You are not thinking of me, I say?
You know my idea of what
Is decent is; you know I move slower
Than many more to whom life has been thrown;
You see, I have been writing tracts
On what is called the Cross and the Stick,
And whether we shall call it a crime to wish death to some warring nations,
And whether a woman be called a CINF and living apart a gravestone
When her head is under that or not.

You are not thinking of me, I say?
Certainly, you are thinking
Of something far more soothing, like myself
Or the soft way I wear my shtick?
You say, if I thought up there on the tropic
I should accost the gentleman of mousetail:
I have the samedream when I wake at night
Except that I am not at all embarrassed
By the fact that I do not yet know the difference
======================================== SAMPLE 235 ========================================
, that hid me in that mind,
Pour from your wisdom, and from your mind
(That from that moment might take is on)
May you dispose the maddest plot;
May you annihilate an ancient race,
To build up a new—that you know not who,
Or from what country, or from what land
They come; and, lo! how shall you defend
Your hateful nation, if our ships
Or topsail no more—our thunderbolts at rest?
May you obliterate from the sun
The zealous western heavens, and all the morn
Devour thro' your old Azores the old sun's
Roots, for your new Buddhas never shall know
Their early light of Asia's crowded west
And all that waves on Jove's vast inlet roll.

Brief for my prologue and last:—
O! why will ever solemn superstition
Engrave these few words in your clear eye?
These really but the foot-notes of superstition;—
Like the ordinary curlic and the Pope's decus;—
Like the traveler's placid shade, like the patient light
That the moon-beams shed; like the white hairs of grave
Night-ship, like the wings and the breast-plates of children;—
These, adorn them as you please; the fact remains,
They have the color of the Night and the Cloud,
Rilke and russet;—how much more, they are the Mystery
And the leper-essence of the Night and the Cloud,
Parted as the order of thy labyrinthine
And broken at every step for new visiting.

Darkness and more darkness:—
Like the more darkness hand the Moon down
From the summits of her peaks in the deep
And the still water. Now again I descry
(Thou canst desist, mighty Hint-finder!)
Sullen, as at my side, the shrouded Moon,
Shadow-colored like the sullen flesh
Of one cut from the common clay. Sunk
To my gaze only she, the Moon that flies
Fouling the world for Sol'ses; glowing
The land only she pours her balm.
Here now she comes, my Pocket-woman
(Queen of the diff'ring lands),
Thou canst not exceed in descent
The richest, the power. On a cup's edge thus
She pours her relief:
Hard to answer, O Composer!
And hard to believe, I'm sure,
What my Quest might have taught thee.
For I've share in all Earth's woe;
Have participated (may be:
For thee, be consistent) long years
Of Blindness 'neath this arid alias,
'Twixt the inessential Closet and the free
Air, when yet my fingers at play
After such long sweet wandering found
Perchance the ring-dowsnips ymirough
To fix the chalice. I've shared all bliss
Of Pleasure's soft side, have been loth
To budge the grain from my pocket,
Have bush't the bar of Soul
At home, impatient of that breath o'er all,

O Hand, how strong I've thriven! But, the fiend
Truly is great, as thou seest, how truly,
As these limpid lawns and streams are moving,
The trees ensephere with self, of self the sphere.
Like the instants when day die night;— The present o'erflows, the heaven
Of Itself infinite, the cloud that floats 'twixt.
Ares, the most terrible of Gods, confess:
Who stands afield before us with beard
And beard's afire, and in his hand
His two-faced ax. If you, companions, did but care
The first thing you'd do is to fling
The hoary rind in his face!
The storm of flesh it will not appear;
It's lulled 'neath a prostrate flee.
He laughs, Zeus will not so constrains
Till he behold his goring bolt.
Ye know full well what harm it does us.
Oye! who have an mind to short and long,
We, journeering in narrower ways
Under a Globe Reddi-luce,
Have dropped in Pythian Thebes our double
Wand'rings, out of which the single way
No studious man would furl, as though we sought
Our home again. So therefore it is best
Once and for all to quit this second-greatest
Abode. Come, since the gods deign not to let us stay,
Let us away, for ere you
======================================== SAMPLE 236 ========================================
Let our hair and hands be moist with thine tears,
And wine and fire; let her tears fall on mine
Unseen, unrevealed; or if thine
Fever is so great that it consumes
Hence our hearts, our hopes and own false pictures
Of true love; or if thy flesh and soft
Short-lived delights and shrin'd self-spoils,
And we that live most slowly move, then
Let us frogo of this; or if thy dying
Be not lengthen'd by the night, yet let
Us do so as more than breakly we may.
So bold a request as these, though made
While tops were lowest, has equal right
With those Of Ceiba or Niphon,

Cities of Lydia, and others, where
Foul birds have foul nest-sites; if there come
Any sickness, either a sudden stroke
Or sudden distemper, to those that wait
About their lovers, but consigning then
No knowledge of the truth, to those that itch
Whilst prayers are in the place, to thee more hot
Let us turn, and to thine business as we turn,
And let the sweetest kisses slide on by
That burneth all heat. How many there are
For whom this means neither song, nor symbol,
Nor pretended deed whereby they should
Be knowers of another. To some
That sense of thy true love in their make
Can be as great a charm as those that find
A great fixed joy in sense. If thou 'sbend
This love not only firm, but true as thou 'st
Be to my Love, I 'm sure the world shall voice
That both are equal, and so made one
The day be thine, and the grave be thrown
More a pleasure for thine equal love.

Who shall retrieve thee? The friends of Mars
May trod thy mould, and skulk all in dust
Around thy mound; as nests of little snakes
Snatch'd and digested feed among
His holes, till tormented by their feet
Behind be set upon their attempts.
Else, with their acquisitions he acquires
Nearer and nearer to his heart his aim
Than he which works or reads, though with the night
At current of long-angled Ocean;
And by that twilight sphere of fires
Is growing now, as near his lips to hers
He grasps and thus creates:
Love, which is joint-amie, whoso that song
Sang of thine initiates, or hooded
Cull'd, shall taste of love, or love's legislative;
And that thy name shall for ever be
Renown'd through many a race; as name
Of nearest star or most honour'd then,
Saving that, each shall have her moment's fame
And everlasting. Thou 'rt now Ennoir'd: thou 'rt now Elysian
Above thine own; next thou 'rt Evrha, crowned
With filial love, which I will ever love
Thee, though Demeter or Heaven sigh.

Magic is Nature's invisible handiwork;
No carvings of man; no sculptors on bronze;
Not a stained canvas; no maestro's strain;
Just Nature and just Man.

Ah, sure, the sea shall shield them both,
When? when shall come again
The happier time of swimming,
That so their name may be heard,
That so their promise be fulfilled?
O man is apt to see through thought
Through seeing, with double eyes;
Sure, each image talks in you,
Both yourselves and us more near.

Do you not see, I say, the risen leaves
Above your home-place having disappeared,
And the tender tints of various hues
Remaining, one in very sooth
Almost purple?
.         .        .        .         .
Are you afraid?
Are you not grieved that the sun should shine?
Are you not glad to see morning-like waters
Again a-step along the lovely beach
?

I'm not so new to-day
As the books that you so much dislike
Are but sets of memories I touch to destroy
In my youth, sirs, that now you ridicule:--
Am I not Paris-wooer even
I will confess as much, or will my lip
Say outright, 'I used, and will always use,
Nature, and not the silly Hell,
Of a writer or a poet's gifts!'
You see, sirs, the book of Shelley
I once had, is not my book
As you know it.  Nay, where's my pris.

For the earth bore up then
Those detesting things one and all--
Cave-women, and birds of sweet swearing.
See now they're away to a tree-tops virgin
Till I ashamed beame:
Boil, broach, gasp, swell and get!
This is, you climate, my man.

I have heard say that in France there is kindness
To the women and the men, which is bunk.
Here are they soft; ah, cook up your rice,
Love too much, or naught to confess!
I'm tired of the goddess-shunning,
I will hate the dim-losing gods.

But I, I am the god of temple-tending
Joys of the making man;
I am that Goddess-shocker.  See here,
I have kicked up my shoe,
Kicked up into my hollow to speak out
On the sill.
Who spoke up first? I am that gull.

And I am a God who has many worlds to celebrate,
Yea, I have stars and worlds in my hand just waiting there
To take me forth and into heaven and pay me,
Breathe on me, give me, in scents and brightness and sweeter
Than of sweetness of that Bye-and-bye hand,
To begin fresh in this June morning, with eyes and ears
And in my heart and in my soul.

What's new in the dance?  Hark, yoursing of dogs
And of cats?  Nothing of the two, I think?
Well, yes, there's a troupe of four who've come over
In a mock-up boat that's drawn up at the pier,
And they are collying to the fancy of the wind,
And up over the water they're slipping and turning,
And tumbling over the wall, and up in the air they flare
An eyecatch from their stalls below.
They're ae polite bunch, and are hugging and scraping,
They're so full of spieling it seems there will be dancing
At some point -- they're such pros, I does sniff,
I smells spring and toast, and music and cake;
'Course, -- but that way lies the Collier & Rees bands.
And the whole fait accomplit, of course, as you see,
Is a great wreck rammed full-on by water and foam,
(Collier & Rees are to collochris "aye,"
But Collier & Rees refuses to do it "nay,")
And they're tumping the tunes -- and the crowd is up there
Crashing and coming up on a tempestuous side,
And clapping and scrawling and holloing and hooting, too,
All joinin' and shoutin', and diversionist-wise,
And a boy who sells pencils as "the bein' down!
Is song for spade," and "match-box serials,"
And it's all pitched up so
======================================== SAMPLE 238 ========================================
 Page, at the roar,
And chide the crash,
From the boundless main
The wave is swimming to us.
The page is amazed, and yet he cannot
detect the trickling song within the cloud,
Which is the source of the stream;
The main has nothing new to tell,
The foam is harkening to us.

Oh, wild and beautiful is the song
Which the springing streams unclose!
And bold and brave is the child
Which sings on the crackling boat,
And talks the live-long day,
With the pole and flag to keep her time,
To the joyous tune which she carries in,
And the summer is not done,
And the sun is not won,
Though the season is over.
The boat is riding on the sea,
Ringing to meet the sun;
But he is music all, my boy,
And his face the main;
He has run so far that he can tell
How this is the case:
The line is drawn, the dance is o'er,
To the sounding drum,
The vane fast by the roll of the bell,
The peal is 100 cents;
And there is nothing left to do but
Roll the ball of the drum,
In the center of the field,
To the swinging bat,
To the swinging chest of the ball;
And this is a very simple game,
Though the children love it.

There's nothing wild about the play,
The children are hardly older
Than their little thought is older,
And they swing with more ease,
And they play a lot more hard,
And have a lot more fun,
Than your mother and your father,
Or your grandmather's son and daughter.

Mothers and sisters they are there
Along with their shoes and their hats,
With their fear of dainty feet,
And their love of thin men.
And the small children are shouting
With the courage of youth,
And the little children under
Will eat just as they sit,
Or even faster, if it's good fun.
And there are curious faces
That come at the view
As the procession moves onward,
Blue and white and looking well.

So it's a very simple game,
Yet the goodness of it is most fine.
It's just a celebration of play.
It's a joyous thing to see,
And the joy in the hearts of the children,
As they march, cross country lightly,
To the playing of the ball.
And the mess of it is very small,
Yet the tongues of them all are strong,
For they talk about it far and wide.

And there are grown-up folks, too, and they take part,
For these are the ones that our land will hear;
The reformers, the thinkers, the teachers,
All of them take part in the game.
They all should try it; it's a very light thing,
Yet the hearts of them run through it.
And they stand through the procession at noon,
And they speak words like these:
"Oh, dear little bitches, here's your play,
Very very good, very much improved.
It's much too long, call it shorten'd out;
But it's played between the children and stool,
And it doesn't involve the hours of despair
In a thoughtful sort of way;
And, if you keep your mind on it, go forward,
You'll be on its basis very soon.

"Oh, dear little bitches, here's your trim-faced game,
Very much like a formal game.
It's served by a trimm'd committee,
Very well organized, very nice,
And very sweet is it, so say these few things
That bear the report of their little committee,
Toss these little formal things about,
And take your little partners everywhere.

"Oh, dear little bitches, here's your fine formal play.
Very much like a business, very nice.
There's a uniform, as by rule, you know,
To begin with, and then you get your suit;
For, in these things, past the title go forth,
You must appear before you your whole life through
In a business sort of way.

"Oh, dear little bitches, here's your costume still.
Very like a trade, a very nice one,
Like a very little church, very fine.
You must go to, oh, such a church as this
To fetch all the very prettiest young boys
To play your games;
And all you have to do, may be worth it,
Is to sit on the right hand,
And rule your little church's

Of skylarks, skylark song,
In which she more than half remembers
Her lost home.

Thus that their words might meet,
And he and she might meet again,
The pilot had rigged his skiff,
The truth he'd lighted his candle-flame,
To tell the fortunes of the day
To lovers who should say,
"The skylarks from Rivendell
Hath told me the names
Of all your women, two and three."

When her outer chamber flamed to see,
With gay grass-roots gold-dust stirred,
To warm her toes, while she lay in bed,
The air of Arcturus blew,
With a dream, she told me of it.
And, "Oh, no wonder, dear, your blue-eyed boy,
At this same Heath, the woodbine blooms.
Spring is come, dear mother-maid, and, lo,
The maid is turned to blossom! See there,
The brambles, torn and charm'd she takes
As, in the brush she seems a brier
Standing, and in quest of flowers! Ah, well--
As you can see from this bud's distress--
I'm not without a witness, Mary.

O, every woman has, stolen from the breast,
And runn'd by friends diskeyn'd and sotted with drink,
Some passionùe wild which was but once her own;
Some furyùe whose only error was springing
From her fair heart, and mangled when it was ripe.
But let her have that and thou hast still thy own--
Thou hast but to name it by that love
Which was but man's, the heaven of each woman's desire.
Nay, by this heart-enthick, heavenly gushing, reverent tape,
This is all wrong, we say; but take it then
Which is real; take the woeful wreck of her
You cannot rue; and move that way this heart
Which has no more course but o' the way, and goes
Where hand can tread.

'Take all things--smiles, loves, tears, regret;
Wire, profit, loss--and weep for all.
Take sighs, drinks, fears, and drunken weeping.
Feel for all,--and so begin to dry
Thy pity for human screwed up dud.
Take laughters, frights, and fears.
Take limits, years, and time on all.
All the sky is flooded with eyes--do wade
Amid the flood, and hold by thestroke of a prole;
Take tears, and let thy heart, like tearless Charon, sip
A bucket of blubber now and then.
Give commodities any vulgar view you like,
Hang, smokes, or scrapings from the soupe.
Give all--
I am foursquare bound it must fail with thee
For any good ending.

'Take music and me; and from the shorn yok'n
Take nature's husband, take the lyst
In her sweetened days,
The hoeditation that is known to her;
And bear all the stammering olympian
Within an amourous plishness;
And thou shalt see how wearied of the thing,
When Miltzanoves round
Thy bones, and all their skill at geck out of date.

'And when this dull-eyed commonplace
Pull up a distaff and lay down their prays,
And have done with excitement; and forget that
Established thing once more,
'Tis not the best,
When I turn to see
The country cottage change to glory shapes,
That is riding on the heart's flattering fire,
As the first air,
All is inspired by love,
The kindling if of iron,
The flinging if of glass,
And will not be beaten down
By all the days and nights of acrid heart.

One long unwritten poem that I know,
That will be read when we are destitute
Is this--in time of trouble or delight,
When friends are heart-struck or disillusioned,
Our friend looks round the same old plate glass,
And says, "Now, 'tis face is into forth"--
But, knowing nothing ofescapist plans,
I let him write upon the glass, and go
To find myself within my fate---to be

When fancy clings to him, old darkness,
And he is fixed as a crumb, I can go,
And pull him by the ears, when sputter rises,
And read the secret when sputter diminishes;

heavenly branch of incense from the heather tree.

The honey-grated pulp the coal-fire under the feet of the cleric.

A fairy-turban's string of chariot-feet. Then the
black withe, the river of hellish wine.
And at the end he swooned in the black slime a flute of

black and red iron.

And the blackness in him the beloved contemplated

and digested and digested its lunacy and then,

"When the deepest darkness girdles me, and when the lightles form

from the sullen sea,

"Then, O Pagan, 'when the deepest darkness girdles thee,

"And when the darkest lightlets darken, let him with thy

"rich madlornstone laugh in the madgrine.)"

When the saint went down and back to the dark world the
ugly brother, the angel,

gave him this sad vision on his way up through the air:

"See the face
of the angel of God, the angel of God, the angel who cries
during the ascension, the deepest of the deeps for the refuge
of man's joy and torment, the last of the dying, the last of
the two!"

"In the black air, during the ascension, there is God's own angel

who cries in the black air, the angel of God, the angel who cries
during the ascent of man's soul during ascension, the last of
the tears for man's joy, the strong-minded angel crying:

'O brother! know thou of no other means nor means with man's joy
and pain to blend and mix, with hate and beauty, and divine

joy and pain, and the god-enhanced gleam of God's sword

and the black slime of sin's prison. The pure sweet spring of the
pure sweet spring! The torrent's roaring, the torrent's
endlessly torturing, the soul's glad triumph!
The foul spoiled blood, O blood! The stream of the stream, the
tortured gush from the dungeon, the brother wailing, the sister
weeping blood, the god loving the god, the man's joy and

joy and blood! The pure joy, the pure cruel joy, the joy the
of the unerring god, the blood which fills but the
small heart of the great heart of the god! The truth, the god-fulfilled
 truth, the god-enhanced truth, the cruel truth!
The heather's god, the balmy air of the balmy heather,

loves and shines and shines because he is pure, because
he is purely self-paring, undisturbed, unconcerned,
because in all else world we think him cunning and
fully smiling. The balmy air of the air of the
chester rock, the plain bliss of the plain, the sunshine

in the wood, the blythe of the bee, the blythe of the

Your poem has in it both old and new ways of seeing:

This poem is old-fashioned; that,
Old-fashioned, it is too. But don't you think it old-

For the passion it possesses, that's for you.

You've no time to be choosy.
Don't you time know better? Don't you
Feels you can live by your wits? Don't you you life have a
Word for 'kill,' as wits have said?
And you have no word for 'leave,' you.
And there's no thing in you that says 'I love you,' there,

And yet I see that you do love me:
I see that you love me. I know.

In those days the oracle was kept by Creon
who was son to the wise Alcmene.
The chest containing fifty organs, four
of which were hidden behind a screen,
divined the oracle and its answer.
A shell taken from a sea turtle's back
aired a suitable movie.
Two birds of prey from two trees
found two fowl, two timorously sound
two feathers.
Two winds from a boomer to boot.
Two birds of prey from two trees
found an owl.
A rocky necklace, a band of copper,
two young girls, two apples, two barley cakes,
two dogs, a beagle, a wedded woman, a hare.

Likely an apple and a sausage
from the bride's own cognac.
Her oracular abilities were used
to good effect.
She even predicted the fall of Athens.
A mermaid in Hubbardgow, no white shirt
and no fish.
So what does a Homer do?
Ships and commerce.
A pot of hereditary envy,
a desire to be angels.
A desire facilitated
by the oracle and its oracle.
A desire to be alive and know the reason for being alive.
A yearning for greater omnipotence.
A yearning for community,
the philosophy of government
in crusts.
A yearning to be the one commonality.
A yearning for one body.
These are just a few.

"Ili admirari Sejmare no Man vs the Battles of Troy", by Athol E. Dowe [Living, Death, Social Commentaries, War & Conflict, Mythology & Folklore]
i

A subtle change like the look of things

is driving you

but you don't care to look back

anymore.

You walk through the door & light the light on

like a game of investments

& you know that people think about things.

But you don't, you keep to the right & the left

like this house still isn't fixed.

i

A man needs no introduction.

A woman does not need to explain

how great she is.

A dove so meant to-is-tried-for-waging-life

does not need to-is-broken-for-t-honey.

For the crying out-as-if-in-waiting-after-nevers crowd

who are only one-and-dones,

a man, a very few

times a day,

will ask himself

what is a toad,

will question the toad's scientific name,

will wonder for one.

A woman will tell him, "Oh sweet child we keep him

warm in the winter,

then cry himself

out!"

A toad's one of the three things God

loves the most.

i don't love toads, I love the woman

who wishes she could be toad, toad toad.

"When you hear the toad, do you

still want to live?"

You should not live.

What should one say to a toad?

======================================== SAMPLE 242 ========================================
 home that he saw,

Exchanged those smiles and fleeting glances,

That common oaths and vows annulled,

And prayed, and prayed to what was left of love,

And called for what was left of grace.

I hasten to him in the morning,

In the noon I miss him in the evening,

And in the night I seek him in the morning.

He comes not in the forenoon, nor after noon,

nor at night, nor after midnight!

The sun goes down, but still he searches for me,

the moon no more searches,

but finds him after long wandering.

When the dawn is red, and sometimes even before,

he goes away alone,

He seeks me at morning, at noon, at noon, and after midnight.

He seeks me by the hour, he seeks me by the day,

he seeks me over the horizon.

When he is found he comes not by the day,

and even at night falls away;

he comes at x-xx of a circle behind.

Then the lonely bird that is lost tries to fall,

but he cannot rise to where his head was last year;

and he is like to fall at the fall of night,

he cannot rise to where he was last year,

and he like a sunk messenger seeks me over the horizon.

I go to the fall of the moon, to the new moon,

to the pearl-pale moon that is new at noon and at night,

I pluck my tendons from the wind, I put them to my breast,

and return to the open field,

to the roof, to the crown, to the disembowered wing.

To the sledge, to the unvalued scabbard,

To the consecrated fire,

to the blind eye over the wilderness,

the blind finger over the poverty.

I pluck the merest tiny shreds,

and lay them as ones apart,

that all may know my dispair,

the solitary strife,

among the few, the desperate, the redeemed,

that fashions a new purpose in the emptiness.

And as I lay them forth again upon the nethermost end

of the tent,

I saw the door at the top of the arch,

and I saw the flame, and I saw the face,

and I knew that it was mine,

and I was filled with fire,

and I was single in the faithless season.

I was single in the unconquered season,

and desolate in the unconquered season,

and seeking in the unprofitable season,

and eating my words,

eating what Master Cragg did,

and Cragg did in the season of joy,

in the season of stopping over alms,

in the inconstant tasting of penns,

in the inconstant telling of tales,

in the looking at the untracked payent tears,

and in the trust of Master Sal,

and the unchristened great hearts of friends.

The seat of the feast was set in the bush by the chair

of hewn stone that held the Pillar,

a rise of two waddises,

from the foot of the pillar of growth

to the head of the bush,

to let the lion into the den of the cock,

and to lead the lost child away.

In the middle of that tent of stones

a hand of clay with clay fingers

was laying yellow sands,

lets yellow tears fall,

to melt in the tears of the children,

and the old tears that master Cragg made,

to buy the skill of the new-weeked,

to throw back the new-weeked,

and be able to say,

Master Cragg was my brother,

Master Sal was my brother.

We were both the masons of piling and putting,

plants of stone,

and contentions and mirrors of words.

We were both of us building hills

into the time and the place,

we would see each other's lips every day

lowering the roofs of the town.

We would sit

casting of nets in the ocean,

of those good stories,

and listen to the howling of whales,

and watch the eyes of tigers.

We would lie

sharing

the suppers of wine,

wet red winter sweet,

ice within.

"The Used-Cat Store", by Stephen Segal [Living, Death, Pets, Philosophy, St. Idy

There was a store that had a window
out to one of the windows in our porch.
He had a dog, and the dog loved him.
And, really, to tell you the least,
it seemed that he was the kind of man
who loved his work.
For whenever he went in,
his dog's name outpeered him, was named Sid.
We'd get him chewing time before noon, on lead,
at the used-cat store.
Socrates, of course, was aware
of the details of his potter's "body
of law," and he'd drop in for a few, quick puffs.
I've seen him head first,
through window, like one of those
jugnuts your cousins used to send.
Socrates would come out sideways,
before you'd know, and settle down
for another drink.
His reasoning went like this: the more
the monkey drank, the more
he'd think, all the time on his back.
This won't last, Socrates would think,
on even a whole year's ration.
He'd always, no matter how hungry,
get out fast, and would flex his limitless
legged way back to the pot.

"The New Species", by George Clifton [Living, Nature, Arts & Sciences, Architecture & Design]
No more you think the tree or the bird,
Those ancient species preserved. You alone
With your want of the ancient species
Periled one last time. You'll have to invent
The art of existence. You have to find
A way of surviving as tree and a bird
That no man has ever done. You have to find
A species to live with in the golden game
That killing one will only lead to more killings
And less and less. You have to find a man.

"The End", by Carolyn Forché [Living, Death]
At last, the end. How fleeting time may be,
And all that glitters, all that cannot last;
The little we see with continual care
May not be our own we have grown so old
To avoid the pity of our children and the pain
Of their departure and the silence at the end.
They are wearing their chains too short to link us shaven-head
As we grow old, until the aisles are bland and softly dense,
And renunciation dawns finally as aaptation, and we're a swart<|endoftext|>Breaking news from the Studio of the Dead: The Metro North Railroad Hit Man,
the Slug Hospital ambushed, the life of the wood
cutter's last words spurned, and the train that blew the whistle
on its way to the landfill.

The trolleys, cast-iron tramps, and the trivial bikes
sloshed in the blood. The old police district, the rain,
the cold beer, the talk ("They'll never print anything
that hits on Durward Hill") and the screamer,
the subliminal and suddenly loud— the odd pizza deliveryman,
the faint laughter from the bedroom about to make an appointment.

We had done something bad, they'd thought, or been tricked
by someone they'd known, or were somehow
assassured to be sitting on vast fortunes.
We were habitual gamblers, though never too long
had done wrong. We had held on to the one things
that were certain: evening dress, unimpedled speech,
the implicit assertion of privacy and wisdom
when faced by a clattering multimillion-dollar a year
goaf burst through the walls of our self-sealed coffined cubicles.

The end of the day, they had been talking about
rising costs, the prospects for capital gains, the fall of the pound,
the prospect of earnings being far more unstable
in the case of a direct hit by the Stock Exchange House of Sex
than it was in the winter. We had argued
the advantages of a quick quench, of putting on steam
only after painting the facades. We had been told
you could lock yourself in a basement with your mate,
bequixitelled to the bell and kitchen, but by now
it was clear the battle was lost.

Consent is consubstantial with us, that
Can do with us what we will, not what we think.
The only question is how little.

On the first day of January, two and half thousand
Industrious lawyers came to see me.
In my life I am usefully full-sized,
Like a shop at Sears with my kit,
The Kangaroo comes in for lunch
An' tries to be out o' sight.
The lawyers come six days a week
For two hundred dollars a head.
The rent so cheaper this year
I do not know why I stay at home:
When they open the door next month
I shall go out with the rest.
I shall be so well looking they wonder
How they hold me.
For direct exposure at all events,
I now feel quite safe to go.
The largess I make at least for me
Lent by the good will of you and me.
I was glad to bring it to you before
It thawed privately, for my friendly effort.
If it is looked at roughly by another
You will be made to pay for it.
For Induja lists will have me look jaded
If I stop to answer such a demand.
I was hoping that you might be satisfied
I would.

"Here it is made, the entrail of the entrained,
The entrained entrained, the entrail entrained entailed,
Ere more delay there is in the lengthened date
Of our entrained entreed entrained entrained."
All adjourned.  The popcorn was sold.
The pop up and pop down.  The entrained entired.
The entrained entrained entrained entrained.  The rain began.

Saw them in the windows of the post office,
See them in the sunshine and in rain.
And I said "No one will know."
But I was slick and RAGGED.  But I POKED
When they came.  But I was UMBER
When they left.  And the word was put to use.

Did I dream of the dream?  But I was PURCHASED,
When they left I was deleted.
So confused.
The way that I dreaded to think I was
I had a wig on and I was RAPID.
And I was a snake and I was SINGING.
I was a noose that was HIDDEN.

Proud of the deception.
The triumphant rapid.
Lemme tell you.
When the ice is right out down to the marrow
The racer is bound to go the way he goes.
I am tired of this cribbership.
Give me apricots and apples!

For she had drunk of wine the wine of youthful
That was subtle and splendid
And wine that was fit to be LOVED.
A wine that was to be FASCINATING
For roses to look past upon the happy
Voluptuous trip that was right there!

O I was delighted to look on the page as it
Was very likely that it was something like
Powder
Come the cloud has come
In an octave which is one of the ways
Of a thing that is INNERLY poignant
For a joy that is meet.
For they were such near people.

The meaning that is in the poem
Is that Rose Rose is a cuckoo has a hen's egg
But I do know what has come to the wine
Is the liquor which she IS ready to serve.
And I am free to say that it HAS GOT a pungent
Ninety-fifth cheer.

For this glass is dreadfully Articles of War.
The neck that is seen here to the right is
Something that is NAKED.
But as the water seen here to the left is
A thing that is HIDIARLY attached
To the left of what is in the bowl,
I will call the squirrel's arm something else
For the thing that is in the bowl.

We look on the pennant, which is white
With DEPRESSION and PROBABLY BAD.
And we look on the mustache, which is thin
And looks like a beak.
But it is not the nose that the bit I find
In the bowl, but only the two things coming
Into a symphony.

There is a thousandth of a minute
To save before we have to shove off
With the earth so trussed as to make
Holes huge enough to throw us up
Into the void.

I did love the bowl,
As other boys, odors, memories,
But such love as is FORCEFUL
FALLING on the thing already tied
As

Their household gods, the air, the earth, they made.
But their own furies, with a new-born fear,
Make them their other gods, and spare not force.
Thus raves the man, that most forbids to do
What he shall chide at others' cost.

But young Rhoce... Volle keeps the measure still,
And never ventures too far from him:
As himself, perhaps, more acts of wickedness
Bent his nature's straitened limit, so never
Can wind so large a whole in one career
Without consequences:  the next moment all
Is lost, and he is Caius; his full force spent;
All, as it was, leaves off his wickedness:

And the next, is Caius good, or evil,....
Here Vona's lesson of the wood begins to learn:
Caius, one born to be foully wrong'd,
Even by the name of Rhoeculus, in time
Shame will learn, and Caius shall be his name.

Eureka! from the deep the soaring mind
Its projected boundary bows before,
As we stand on the verge; and o'er the stream
Thrice bending to the left the weighty load
Our eyes unweariedly bend, and sweep
Slow down the Riber, till from so far
Under the roaring stage turned blind
They find us, and descry the confines of our world:

Now seek we, in their fearful onwardness,
Some secret push of country dark as night,
Where history is the pinch of frost, and man
The lizard, creeping up the soil, to find
The relics of a broken run, or hostelam
Within the smoke, of such as still remain,
UNTO DEATH KNOWN, the once proud halloo of mankind.

One hour they plann'd the works of law, to lay
Had traversed country; else, all undone,
Had been as well as Rome;--from the seventh light
They flight began, and to these screams their speed
Brake return'd.  We hurried after, unweigh'd
The year's new joys, nor remembered whence or why
The starry games were set, nor to what purpose we were brought.

My friend, my country!  I shall not seek thy land
In history, as a separate nation,--nor yet
Can I divide my history upon a plate;
Nor can tell what perils we are all along
Of the future, unless by the tracks of dying generations;
Nor how our fathers' graves may be generous estranges,
Nor what it is to come at.  The sun shining here
Appears as at the dead world's cold moment we behold,

Yet at one time I had not look'd on earth, but that on her
Sunk with his own breath.  From him I have seen
So many things that Advent will o'er us renew,
A preacher, and a murderer, and then a deacon,
A pontiff, a. d. c. B. D. , a witness of the truth,
A felony, a wedding, and a war,
A grim determination, and a freeman's doom,
A flute, a morion, and a wildfire,
Mis-couer, miser, masquer, and sacrileger,
The floggings of a wizard, a glaring goose,
A murder, a seizure, a mercy, a sleep,
A morning, a sickness, a death, a coin,
A calm, a renewal, so smooth on all sides,
We still might wonder sporting from a nation's mouth
What ending there can be to the tale of then and now,--
That last gasp of transience?  Then we still would find
A answer from the brow of ev'ry tear,
And none of this riddle cleverly men call Death.
My country, my grave!  And thou wouldst then be all
A toon of colors to me in its whiteness!
I have dream'd of thee much and much has happened since
The shadow long sported in my anguished sight,
And yet thy name, my country, thy dear name,
Crying to me from ear to ear, and telling me
That day by day thou art of me wroth or glad,
Humble or proud, me ever one with thee to be
Amongst the others not the least of three or four,
With thee I made a country, thee mine, foray
At an unhallowed hand, at a hostile race's insult,
A war against a wrathful sea, at a queer ordain'd
Division,

'mantike the way that they were designed.
That now, on earth, they still might go
Like ravens with staves for wings,
Or frogs with shoes of felt for feet,
Or like a flea upon the sleeve
Of a snuffing young gentleman,
A kind of insect besot,
By a Venetian merchant,
Apoint of interest, but a point
Less than the neat intent of the world

Let me take as an argument
For the pursuit of its worshippers
Some bits of knowledge so bulky
That the reasoning powers struggle
Beneath them how to of them can form
One aggregate, and if there may be
One enormous question in the world
On which all knowledge and all belief
Should fall to the ground in unresisted trances,
This is the point to mention it--
Whether love is a substance, and thereby
Whether the sun is a sphere or not.
It is so monstrously absurd
As to say the sun is a ball, or that love
Is an unreal name for an egret's feather,
And why not why the music of both
Is a voice within us hearing alone,
And whether what we see with our eyes
Nor is but a murmuring of sounding sounds,
Is it not why man should be silenced?
So, on the question of their proven
Denial, my colleagues and I,
Have divided ourselves off some yards
For hypothetical craft
Where we think of heroic Achilles'
Assault and defeat at the gates
Of Thessaly, and whether the event
Was achieved through fiction or historical fact,
Whether love was obtained by danger,
And whether possibly the Thessalian suns
Were daily distributed among their stars
By Caliph Hisham, and whether, perchance,
The Persians had not made good their side
By forces and conditions which were then
Given to prove their supremacy,
And whetring their sabres, so far as they
Could, so that the results were as they
Could by themselves achieved enable
The lands above the marsh and bog to hear
The sounds of their disputing from a hundred hills;
Whether, furthermore, were worth while
Such a pursuit for the odd result
Since the case of Helen and Hector
Is, we (the hasty phantoms who went
Radha and Patrick to discuss it) found
Into the mouths of mankind
Much that is laughable, many things
Worth while on such a quest for love.
(It has been confessed by some, that he
Made just in tarrying, else all funny
Be tried, and his wise head would have done
A double service to the Anglo-Norman
And Christian Empire, both as now the arms
Of each would have prov'd the other prompt and use,
Wherein men both save their Christian or at arms
Induc'd by losses learning time has no tide

But the case is different with us, since,
As we all survive the Revolution, our lost
Language and even the Old Testament,
Even as the English now, in spite of it,
Rarely if ever mention'd, is supply'd
With modern doctrine) we must now defer
To the Old Testament, since it is surrender'd
To the New, and much to syllogistic ease,
Since great elements of the world, to wit:
The Ins and outs of Commerce, and what happens
In aerial eagles, and waves, and lakes, and seas;
Equally match'd our credulous fore-knowledge
And weak nettness, have deckt with nonne larceny
As with a net incirclorium, that has been snares
Against our eares, and captivated even
Are with a soneday, or meris byfill'd with slewh or lies.

Foolish it was, our casting off pre-eminence
And scaring the anointed crowd in the braying
Of illumin'd brutes or throats that rang above
Our empty environs; not that, or broad casting
From the Charlies and the Amtons to the heart
Of num'rous parmelees, formed for quiet feeding
Of late far better pleas'd and easefull meat,
That sitting fast and ev'nly not expir'd
But for warmth, flung up their meat, like wols'lep shedd,
Whirl'd into the air, the which they sees to siccanic chace.

For ev'ry chain of men, in so close a covering hid,
From far less through refracted honour clings,
But the high-crown'd Prince insures his next hsion's fall,
Since succession equals going out, and he next
In succession faints, or, lat'd or recid

To fight for your right in battle.

And my faith says I shall follow you

Angels of death and murder,
Under a rug of fibres.
They have stolen enough;

Only the old sex, only the old sex."

You, you, unselfish, honest man,
Whose soul draws to the Ideal,
Your strange eyes glancing through the years
Canf light upon me.
And through your eyes I see
The impotent lust for gold,
And the revengeful thought
That follows each righteous deed
That comes from heaven down.

You, you, you, were driven forth
Into the desolate wood,
And it rubbed off on you.
And you have been in debt,
And it rubbed off on you.
And you have heard the criticism
Of those at the wheel;
And you have thought that sand
Could sharpen iron.

You, you, you, could not make
Sanity attain
By just settling there;
But behind the thought of you
An unreached-for shore
Is, though 206 miles long.
And it is rubbed, and it is pricked,
And it is stared
By Sanity everywhere.

You, you, set up the Light
That stands fast in London streets;
The Holy Sacrifice of Light
Lays its appeal to the flesh;
The ape club strikes deeper
 into the Barbarian Wood.
You, you, have sold the credence
To the self-elected Saxons.

You, you, have put forth the Word,
Impregnable and rich,
Untransciled, unsanditable,
Intricate, all adored,
But it is shreds that every one covets.
Your infinite Word permeates
The split sea piece, the fragment
Balloons its delicious bugs in all its fleetness.

As a wash of salt oil on the dishes
Rises a soft glow in the sunshine,
The immortalized memory of the past
Lights the now and the then of the future.
The self-annihilating self
Splits itself into dual,
And the ideal yearns to be
In the order of permanence.

So, in the years to come, each gloomy
Venture of a life will be built.
And one by one the fantastic
Remember their fancied abodes,
And their fragmentary spell
Sink on itself into impotence,
Burning out all they name and seek.

I, too, shall have won, like him,
Full pounds of merit: I, too,
Have strode among the undead.
I, too, have seen the self cast down
From its last high heaven in scorn,
And have picked up fragments here
Of its form; but I, after all,
Quit my separate world for ever.
I, too, shall one day come to
Myself, without the intervening
Divine interposing shield
Of essential willpower or wavy
Merged with me, and be caught up in
The universal soul of things.

Then shall I go down to the dead,
Succeeding sorrow,
And show my bankrupted soul
In the separate, tainted.
My seed, perforce, shall grow naked
To the dust, and learn the weight and
Worry of the having be.

And, after all, the thing shall go
With a faint blush of regret,
To the common dust of everyday;
The passionate blaze of laughter;
The deeps of emotion
In the upturned face of earth.

And then the moustaches and wigs
Shall take to their forgotten chores,
And the mirth of Muggsie nation
Shall seem a troubled anear,
Careening about the vasty
Dark hours that were.

"Visions", by James L. Dickey [Sorrow & Grieving, Love, Heartache & Loss, Relationships]
Visions are on the road—
high-won grass, big-grown
big blockfaces in the
pass-riven corner
pass-un-built, pass-worn-white with grass
that knows some tough lessons—
and vays who pass looking for
something they want—in this
passionately rugged place.

When I came along
they were all emblems
of life—long-lost
love, wisdom-pined—
and now they are nearly
forgotten.

There is one that I have kept,
just for this hour,
weighing in the balance
wistfulness, heart's demand
unavowed: the vision
of a man, long-shouldered,
his throat gone square and thin
and his shoulder slanted now
in the mist of a fight,
toward the blade that is burning.

It seems a fool's game to fight
the way I have fought, wrapped
in the pall of something beautiful:
and all the time I think
I'm less a creature of desire
and more a creature of decay,
for in this likeness hold
no tenderness for me
as I am of desire.

I watch my son grow from dreamy slit event to full-grown earthquake by week's end, But I
was never there, never hitchhit by the pickup's unsettling inevitability. I never huddled up for a ride or got free because I
was home for so long, because I had girlfriends to attend to and poems to puff, but my: nothing compared to the mute activeness of stuttering on the pavement, the orphan memory of its liquid throne and wholly unsuitable sprigs. It never quite comes around, the strenuous dooms lost in a storm of allegiances. The performance's as much about being shy about the random as being defiant, I suppose, and the eventuality is just a matter of getting on a bandwagon and staying set. But being seen around. Being cute. And, you know, being cute.

and that was at dusk

when the sun had gone

and all the others had

gone, too, but me

on his finger and

always went away in the same

So that was why I sat
down on a log

because

the older was the one

======================================== SAMPLE 251 ========================================
The patient damsel wore
No dress of silk or satin;
She wore a gown of fresher hue,
A silk which was full of dye.

As I rode beside her on my way
She always stopped and looked behind
Upon the very back of me,
And I, in turn, gazed up in time
At her warning eyes that warned
Me, in spirit, of my way.

Of her fair countenance I could trace
A playful grace and sweet illusive grace,
Which were not quite wise or sure;
A countenance like a cartoon fool
In ruse verges not on error;
A light headed horn of eyes,
A satchenine spirit, set aglow.

As a fool the love-bird plays, who sees
A rolled ball and joking gold;
So her hands and feet, that were on walk,
In merry habit studied go.
But she plucked at her song and wandered,
As all her mates did too,
Among the grass to peruse and flowers,
With eye wholly out.

And thus I knew her, though I knew her not
Whose face I wore:
She looked at me as I pondered a text
I learnt erewhile, and yet I now,
As with new-caught garner, spied
In likeness of a passing woman
That sway'd a great man.

My lover, of happy times in store
Such as to me was dear.
His steady hand I knew within my own,
And where he kept his door,
I'd enter and follow off a latch;
I knew the spots he kept sacred to,
And hers to touch the farthingoon.

His little spot was where there was a tree,
On which he sat and spoke with his hand,
His voice still firm along a discreeter tone,
A living man's mouth,
Thin, clear, forcible, and well-knit.
And hers, of every musings that drave
Through grass-grown men his life to tread,
With such dash that as I still did scan,
I kept a faint smile in my breast,
On all her and hers there fell
Was a cry of a well-lovely thing,
With inner meaning unfulfilled:
But she fled and I sought in vain for more
And a speech that I knew of my love,
Within her body there was one word - NO.

That I'd use my strength, not my pretty lips
For frail charity with my kind eye
Lookin' to a heart that was sick or just dead,
With all a man can do and almost all a man can Tear up those creeds that the fals teacher adresses
(Creeds that maltorthe children at their mothers' teens;
The people that rejoice in the plough and harvests
When the hail rains and the ice is of the year;
And sects that adorn the head with idol-deeds
And ways that are caught from the bawling mart,
And creeds that your mean eyes are well pleased to see)
And that pore on the Scriptures that are old
(Which the reave-potatoes still adored
And which the same God that yesterday wedded

That He then made red once more, but which no man knows
Why He should come twice, and He should remain
On earth angered, and the new-made red again)
That's the text that I rub by Dwightena;
And, if she be not attractive to me,
Being of that sub-question agreeable,
I'll knock out her in white barrack scourgings and grim;
And hang her dress with the other laundry's tags,
And cut her into pieces; or, when I do,
I'll just say that 'he is here first-born'.
Or, if my self, discerning, having thus dosed
The spirit of her negation, guess
And rules by sides the answer is, -55-
No, I. She is my cousin, by acknowledgment
To whom I don't owe a kind embrace,
And therefore a member of the loss.
This I gain when she is cut up, and stitched
In endema of all healthy margins;
And when she makes me fun ('tis her effect,
I might have wit to prove it, whereon
I actually stick a leg or grow)
And the last part is, she is detuned.
The end in which she goes is, I guess, -56.

(CH.itudes Fr. and Long. ii. 48).
Else I should tell all how my wit and

 of fashion,
Then she, I think, forgot to complain,
Till she said, "Canst thou for ever be
Alone in a life that is thus weary?
Who hast yon time but me to be the keep

"The beauteous nymphs! Who care they if they make
"Their bowers
"Of dainties only, or sweetly fill their locks
"With vermin, other way round the head
"With gnats, and Giardia, and black silf, and man,
"A monster of the throned, Drusarium!"

"O thankless!" "Ill-treated!" "Accursed!"
Were the curses that inly blazed
At the virgin's piteous sighs;
"The royal serpent! Drusilla fair!
"Thou hast knowledge of a thrift that would prove
"Years of torment in a year!"

But it came into the poor maid's thoughts
To make it evening in the streets,
And some one murmuring there,
The music of the summer, singing;
And she would smell the wind
And air with insects pattering;
On fast her hair would fall and beat;
Rub its snarled cheeks with pulses;
Then stand for a space, all streaming, and
Shivering; with a dead language tune their heads;
Then distant sounds of striding would come,
Strange, uncouth, terribly gowned men,
Not men that she knew, but strange without form,
And she would see the rolling eyes,
Sunken, hard, with eyes of lightning;
And she would catch a pulse that would burst,
Fill herself with fear, as roused she stood;
Her eyes would fast unto the cold ground,
And say, as nothing under Heaven,
"What is this?"

Then she would see,
But no, not of earth;
Not of that, the thunder, famous,
To which earth, thunder, opposition gives;
But as to him she seemed the light,
Herself she should have been;
And he would pass,

So she thought,
But no, not of fear
Which had been writing, even in her,
Yet she wrote, and at his unsealing
She would be still;
And this he saw
But she
The words may know.

From him she saw
That the place of light, that waits for love,
Is not the only light that lures;
But as one door was another man,
So the one word in an endless letter,
In an endless journal.

This is the Spirit of old laws.
But he to whom it is given
Has no rule except the rule of free will.
It is the light which he permits in
This world, in each simple deed and thought,
Shall show him how far his life goes;
And he shall see in it his glory end.
It is his light to try for in his life,
And his perfect light shall measure its desire.

For he who hears the slow pendulum
That swings with all the favorite stars,
Out of the death-bed of the past,
And looks that memory gropes for,
For the lost link of what has been,
With hope's heart he must abide
While all the dreams of long ish,
With all the pride of the hopeful eye,
That longs for the unstopped tongue,
To tell how much its eyes dilate
To the kingdom of forseeings.

For he, whoever he may be,
Will find, when all has subdertained,
His furlough at last;
And the ineffable bliss,
The ideal, the calm eternal morning,
The new child-colors he remembers
In his island home;
And then, no more vexed with doubt,
The end he shares
With his youthful heaven-land.

What is that? Alas, too facile!
And can it be? No matter. For the best,
He took a step, and had to follow it;
And, lo, the meadow he trod,
Not only its single stripe of grass,
But the full crest of it,
A full half of it, tall
Hyacinths and lilies rose.

It was the property now,
Undo all earth's lovely color,
Undo all pain, undoe all pride,
To strike a mortal to be generous,
Lip-wing and spirit, wedded to victory,
At its old drudgeries.

Areddon, what is this thing?
Its name he did not keep;
It was so adorn'd.
He was not steer'd
By the
======================================== SAMPLE 253 ========================================

On a kind shrub, and on his head
A vest and tunic wrapt around,
But, while he thus was mute, the youth,
His own master, answered him thus mild.
Thou biddest, I believe, the child of Jove
Should hear the message from my sire.
To whom then said Apollo, great and sure

Ius 'tis who not alone with me
Hath this wondrous cure for sickly folk,
But him, the one in all from nought alienated,
King Priam. For Priam so exact is laid,
The final issue of his law to king:
And in the true heavenly light who court alone,
Sees all the future as it shall be had.
A banquet bound his first to me gave,
And him he serves, who gave the feast to all.
Let him lie then without blemish dressed
And the joyous feast attend thee all.
He finished, and his hearers served,
And in his turn he began. Yea, yea, he saith,
This feast fit for a great man's sharing,
Which cometh once, and will not come again.
Let every one be freely share it who will;
For this is fair the folk's and the meal to see.
And whoso despises so much, God may take
With fury his eyes and ears astound.
The meat and the drink were indeed best,
So good were the folk's; but what the peeler's did
He toilous, to his hands ungrateful beareth.
For so vast a portion of the feast lay there,
The generous hands of the keeper desert
Degrees twice-handed, and with tireless pull
Untiring; where'er the cleaver atones,
His tender years, in my command, forgat.

So was the ancient Cleberian led away
To Latium, Smyrnon, and Vendemia,
To be the bane of many a sinful woman's bed.
But of this plight Apollo, in awe and fear
Cast down, the guardian of his sickness.
So short a time Earthless remained behind
An invisible power; and in that new world
He went on as he was led, though maimed and woe-disploited.

And, as day by day he slipt from the skies,
The years wagged less and less at Prosper's side;
And on she bounded, as if she had winged for air.
As a crane to the saddle, so she passed
From god to god, where the Arcadian king,
Slawsonas crown'd with spices, beheld her pass.
And he rode with her; but as on its back she fell,
He drop'd off into a semblance of night.
And with a low laughter, For-ies begirt with day,
The laggard Alphesibelle may still sneer at doubt.

She gave him gold, and gave him sowing; but for what?
The world laughed; and in that gold he find'd a ruin.
He took his wife and left her; and again, for her,
Gorges sea-rollers to the open main.
And all are laughter still, when, like a shaft shot out
Into the body of a mighty tree,
Was his swift passage; and a God, it slips
Through transparent limbs and furling sails.
He enters; gold and sowing he finds; but gold
But not the world can hew to its shame
His victorious journey, and his firm ascendency.

He cannot get at his ascendency. Alas!
His appliance is as a door which fast-prius is
locked; a disappearing dream. He comes, sets up, and goes;
The crowd waits; not one of them can get to his ascendency.
No more than this on earth was he useful: but on earth
He went to battle, and his going was excluded.
It chanced that Phoebus was set on giving day
To Saturn; Daphne was set on giving day
To mighty Zeus; and a gun was heard to ring.

At this, in a thick cloud, the glory of goats,
And adjoining glittering bands of thick swarms
Of butterflies, and running stags. He crosses
A bosque of sparkling night that, under mould,
Flames with ill-bORDerer throughout, and blazes forth
An abundance of golden light; and, at the end,
As through other heaven, a number of lesser lights

Five mirks, in number of the blazon'd bee,
Five goat-wings on the breast of the unwarming whiteness,
So great a lustre infernal as en

John Pascher, a farmer, was found dead at his farm
Homeward, by the old Peden road.
Then Percy Cooke, 'Sidney Coupe, a fine specimen of blood,
had gone to ground. On his coffin were some initials,--

'A person wheer the Devil's in trade
By his fellows is addressed.' In Sidcup Field the Scots Fusillade
changed the subject. The Baker of Don what is his name?
Found dead at his house, with cuts through the heart.
So Sidcup's fine sod may not be so porous
After all. My wife's impatience for a search,

Almanack for the next hour the beds will be.
Meanwhile, we have a search of the house.
Shall we mark? There's a leg at full length in the street.
See what a mess the steed and the mule had been
Here, and what a mess the floor was when they passed.
A corpse amidst the debris, and it is late,
But I remember a cornfield in Norway on a day like this,

And a dead ox in the debris,
And some boards and bits of a clock,
And the everst lovely termagewear white,
Albany and Othof,
Near Königsfeld, land of ice,
She lived near Giesecke, saw Ch Beauty each day white,
And walked to and from her meal with heads turned to the beat.

And along the banks of the Elbe a pine-tree grows,
The river's bed covered with boats in and out,
Horses' trappings, a bit of a saddle, lying in a line.
Houses for the horses, and wide and spacious vista views.

'Now out, Howe! give me a bit of ye, Howe,
Out across the river yonder, where the wood's thick,
There's a cottage, and the light's all that's ours.'
So up I raised my butt to go,
The wrong way, to go,
Up against them too, the pairs.
'Out across the river yonder, where the wood's thick,
There's a cottage, and the light's all that's ours.'
'But out across the river yonder, where the wood's thick,
There's a cottage, and the light's all that's ours.'

At Sidcup, where the bridge goes over the river Elbe,
A page in a haze of parching heat
Comes down for a breath of the calm,
A moment, broader sight on sight,
Then back as soon as it was seen
Comes to a sudden rest.

A few steps more and there's a house enough,
So close that it supports the depth,
A few more and then the sight's
In a moment destroyed.
But I passed, as I thought, through the gate,
Where another page came down, at full pace,
A dozen steps more, to keep the end in view.

She had her sight arrested, had in sight
Already crossed the river, raft, that flows,
Already where the firmest currents flow,
The confluent current's abashed course
In three streams, down, up, across the spheres.

But already then
She advanced, as if her course was good,
She flew in the air, like a stone,
Slow, but in steady swing,
Between the waves, which are her food,
In waves more clear than either, she dons her wings,
And clears that which she aims to avoid,
Till in a sunny, or a storm,
She sees obscure things, and where none is,
Flashes out, and is gone where she may go.

There came a form in the air, bare-headed,
And great-souled, yet patient of blood.
That was the Duke, who

A ain sma ee,
And a smore caliver.

Nor looks back spake he spake na she spakes na

She turns to the Duke, and her new prig's child.

She'll not allow a fac's in her glass,
Nay the naething she wins she tills,

 areas,
The watch in the city streets
Wakes him into slumber;
In the gloomy, rustling
Woods and open spaces,
The cat's voice is heard
Warmly and solemnly
Lifting welcome,
As the priest speaks of duteous
Places
Where the people follow the brown
Herbs and flowers of the gardens,
Places where the flickering clouds come
Out of the sun,
Butterflies and moths are heard
Transmitting
Lullaby, as they glide
Under the stars, and where
Wonders glitter dimmily,
Far beyond, the sweet ways
Leading the passer hears not,
Till a tune begin.
This hath happed to me.

These the hours are hard to bear,
Sad, sad to stay.
Till day be coming,
Till rest and peace brightening,
And friendship sparkling,
Starlight be taken,
Happiness too, as if
The world had come about you,
Yet the best is uncertain
Save that he hath found his rest,
Who the best loves of all.
Then, lead me unto the windy
Woods and o'er the murky,
Far from the home that is joyous,
Where the people pass away
Knowing naught.

Hast thou not many days left
With thy heart contented,
O Sun-set! in the diving
Woods where bats go bowing,
Where the sky-lark singer
Justly goes settling,
Shining forevermore,
Now the day is dying!
Cura signs the way,
Cura that doth hold
All that is handsome
Now within thy West;
By thy sweet stars
The sun shall love thee
With new glory, when thou
Wast almost dead.

What grave men Bucolics
They strut with who think
They break the peace when they
Tear avouar and sign
They do not think.
When Bucolics hold
Togging and Tally-ho
They will say 'tis.

Ay and they will be
Better men then
When they hear that I say
They do wrong, or who say
Worm as Herr Scald brought.
He made a game that is not.
With his flowers and game, I ween,
With flowers that still are here,
With Bucolics' game
He thought they worth while.
He knew they were
Sweet, when he from the house
And the gate and the tree
Just went to break
The eave, and threw his men
There behind to see.

The wind is whirling the brook!
It is wafting him away.
But the rippling water's
More sundown, more soft.
And the buzzing bees
Follow the trail.
He is coming, He is coming,
Coming, Coming,
With a wax wreath,
And a yellow beard,
And a swaying stick.

But the old man sees
Over the ground,
And he hears the bees,
And he sees
The buzzing bees.
And he feels
The wax wreath,
And he turns to a tree.

Thinking of his riches,
His Western Land,
And his horses more
Of course than any,
And his sugarcane
And his gourds and things
Coming home in it,
And the Fiery King
Coming home, coming home.

He is coming, He is coming,
With a wax wreath,
And a yellow beard,
And a swaying stick.
Coming, with wax wreath,
Coming, with a golden beard,
With a fiery King,
And a yellow wig.

The Sun's lights are dim,
The Makers' powers are gone,
The Wuchsaleasts are dead.
Rings are dead,
Tolls are dead,
Sand is dead.

Through the crunching snow,
And the Frozen Head,
I hear the gun shots,
I hear the cracking,
But I hear, I hear
Mesmeric sounds that mix

What a social pact that should be!
How the snowed-off parts
Conjure up distant ideas!
I may set down aloud what's dead
Instead of the recklessly angry
Drama that ends tonight.

At the crossing, urge traffic
 Noll on traverse here

Give each man a place,
A finger on his first
Ever the place
Give a finger,
Or a place

At the first-eveloppeled wall

Where the grass is safe,
Where the last couple bend,
Of these words the first,
Of both be silent,
To represent
The ungent

And mine the frowns of right and wrong.
To open eyes, to rouse and prompt,
Thou art the floweriest of the fair.

She's the bloom of the fairy race,
The dearest little flower that grows;
She shines with enchanting might,
From out her rosy button head.
How should I sing of her, or write,
But all I read I praise in rhyme.

She walks soft in the velvet gloom,
And glides lighting down the stair;
She closes with diligent courtesy
The business office at her feet.
To mothers so well-respected,
And to the women who are brave,
Her grace is a cherished gift.

When I have stopped to sigh,
And look towards the glimmering turf,
Where God is walking, some days, behind;
I think that I hear the sound of thirty
But in the green, thirty is none;
And all the trees, all so tall,
And all the birds and briddles sound the holm-o'er,
In ear-deep grass.

When I have stopped to praise,
And cast away my soul's best wine,
For pairs and warm and far away,
And Sunday mirth and Sunday play,
I hear the woods laugh with me;
And I hear the sound of feet,
And the sound of mouths that chatter,

If she turns back to the Border,
Back of the snug and the quiet,
Where the brooms are restless and black,
I hear her loud and queer
Call out and with all her might
Waltz to the sunshine and the red;
And I hear the spangled cob
Tinkle dimly by my bed.

If she goes to the ends of the earth,
Where new worlds are new roads and springs,
I hear her singing home to you;
I hear her singing, singing always,
Picking her tremulous roundelay
And the glass of apple-flute sound.
She comes like the yearning of sea
When snow-floes creep and pass and spare;
I hear her coming with the dawn,
Comes one that all new worlds can quench,

No man is false to love or bargain.
And so often they deceive us,
We that bargain and we that love;
But never do I know a fool more brand
For having found it a joke
To fool all Mirth till she quails
Into Adam's safety.

In vain we have all agreed,
And trod the dusty laws and lasted,
And done what seemed their kindbest,
Till fell havoc from without,
Like a grey November day,
And stunned hope, and longing vain,
And brockaged barters shot through,
And filled the world all 'neath the palm,
With unheeded possibilities.

And for all this I remember
That not so many years
Were forced between the morning's smile,
And merry ideology,
As one to whom I said "Remember me."
By whose good priviledges I have been stung.
For I remember Established Truth,

And that he said, I know, and Truly,
I have, indeed, but taken the fool's herb,
The id man's somaticardia,
The tea at its herald term,
The mirage of health 'round the paw
Of some shortfooted cat.
For all that, did he but love me once,
I had but toyed with an unsummery lust,
Forgetting whets keen on downtime.

The grey maid, with the splending mud-where nest under her eyes
Said, "O a sanctipjohnitor general,
We have lain we had laid estray
Forvey Gurneman, owner of the parlor of yore,
And others, the like of whom are not.
Here have we domiciled peaceable throng;
At dawn from the entrance of the rocks they pardy;
And as they were no fortune they thankfully
Thought the bustle of the era of grandeur days.

With that she set her teeth on one side;
And by wakened ears there was music sweet.
She had a pail from which she braced the crowd,
And a oaken spade from which she waterfed
The hairy trials from her hairy chest;
And she kept the round of gossip fair or dire,
And had for her throughout the room full for wind.

She had ten visits to bear, and twice that buske,
Since Established Truth, and its abettors,
Had opened wide the fruitful earth and bade return
The soul to haunts of the inmost life;
And so with all modesty of mind she

'Scape--scape, I beg you,
Do not thou my wounds upon my breast!
These wound the same, and I shall die,
And I must after-times allege
'Cause of thy'n injuries; no whit of blame
Else thine are those: 'tis mine.

Mephistopheles. Don't make any hast thou can;
First get thee forth, and tell thy scared
To get some water, for my breast
Is wound about by every rock
In this so great a horror; no water strick
I durst therewith, I might not thus
Pour upon my face, and so my breast
Ajin--but a wind, in white array,

Was moving up and down the shoulder
Of all the others, and was seen
 to gleam o'er the walls, and behind
All was seen to rise up from thence
And give a great rooster's peal!
All were then surely soon awake; but I,
I slept till all the point was told,
The second cock came not; then Bird of night,
Crashed in my brain, and all at once
Stayed in his flight up to the loft,
His brawny-nerved beak half-angry
Bared to my eyes, then settled round
Against my heart, while more distant
Two clouds, drawn up and over Heaven,
Met in floor, and the sun went down,
And Night gave breath to Light, and they were
Both gone! But Light in bed, with Love
Flashing in his eyes, asked me,
"Whose palace is this?" I said,
"The Count of Walsinglonga's;" Light whispered back;
"For so the Beloved's palace is,"
I knew his voice, "but let it be!
All night I live here, and when I die
This verdant bed is where I die."
So weezen love is, so weezen
Ey knew they be, so close they pressed
Each other, and their loves set free
Should be, but neither curst the bout,
For love and sport were full thro'th me;
Till on the following morning light and sleep
Cradled each other, like a ship at sea,
Then we began to cary, from the bed;
I took her hand, and, Dancing Westaway,

And along the doored roof's terrace, they
Met at the gates again, till, in a jewel
A smyring piece did burn above each head.
And when at Evian we sojourn there,
Which sale rationed folk to stay, we
Stood, two, by claims of our true love;
Love, wishing we were dead, to us made line
Not a dear garland, but an inky thong;
And in that solemn chancech touch,

And at large last Awaiting to appra
The judgment of Earth, and Gold, and Love,
We blest them to Peace, who counted our foines
Of likes and stays the best of jews;
And, continu'd in those Confessors,
We besought the Vulg. Reg. to send
A quart of wine by McCarter's rule,
Whose blessed door his work Uncas made.
For this wine we had bee somewhat ashamed
To send you, and had made you ether
A minor priest in the Priesthood:
But whisht to our request, hee made us clear,
That he did neither drink nor dine:
And 'twas his cider-shoals, so zealous,
You had them in the least where's Parson Sands?
This wine had wherewithal to give to them both,
And he done proudly as he saild by ours,
To lie Witness for the road he passed through.

Well; the first call is justine,
The second is worstine.
The lesser Priest Garmad was sacrificed
By his lesser maids,
And as the mother of God she tore his heart;
And Sire Pimpdemosfellner did follow:
And now I am busied from heel to head,
To pray for this and for, pray both;
As fast as shirt of nere seen
I had it off my neck,
Pray for them both, Paddy Connor.

The kettle went round, the pot was brown,
He piped as he was boussed,

And bore the name of ben:

Our faithful friends the pigs,
(With the brains of course,)
Rode on the moorland
(Sleds were brought for sale.)
Our group of like-minds
(Just as we were said.)

To Sunday-school ("Christian" state.)
Our love-in-winter:
A kind of two-vooer'd lot.)
Our hosts without name or place:)

All went on health and trade,
(The bellows sold well 100 pence.)
Our shepherd, the pig's lot.
Our host, Mr. Jones,
Was chief to-do:)

And found the right inhaling,
In sooth, a keen surprise,
And still, he hoped for more:.)
(A bargain, he found, who knew 'em,
When he found he could not borrow 'em,
He'd lend his friends his neighbour his lungs
Before he found he was too old a friend to need 'em.)

And then, he knew his Christian place,
And joined the poshest club in whistling reeds
(That are not at first the brightest blooms.)
But his grace to none that's tame
His posy of "queer-at-eft"
The most delightfully damp and showery
(As if rainbows 'ud do it enamel!)
Was this year's flower, the lordly pancake.

So much for his own position:)
He cantered to the door,
He self could pay, he said,
Out of his cheep he would pay
Any amount--of Pounds--Pounds--Pounds--
That any sum that can
Go, I'll pay any shillings, shruggings,

If any nice gentleman
Spare just twenty quid
For one so fair as I
(And don't forget it!)
Remember, when you do, I'm behind
In what I've said, I shall be very clear

How, for my part,
From morn till ill-bye,
I hold myself
Behind
Confounded in a corner,
Behind
Full-brimmed, though starved and broke,
In what I say, though I don't have enough

(And you don't count your losses).
I've lost my starters:
The 'New Switja Lines' I bought and paid for
I dropped one day:
One serious ticket, just for the front door
I followed through a situation
With a police report
Filed and appealed against (which was too bad),
And one for 'pas and 'verys the others went through:
But I'm not through with laughing:)
Last, but not least, at the end of all
In the red-score city-halifax of day,
Where I found a warm air move
From all sorts of rooms
And chimneys, as if they held
One dead man of sin
Beneath them whole and dead.

But it isn't so:)
I'm here, I'm fat!
I'm here, with one half-hour to spare,
And I've something too,
An ode, if my modest tongues shall deploy
Enough to warn you of my pen.
But the tongue can't reach
Her Zodiac jest,
That flower which hangs like a broken sprig
Over the Singer's house-front there:)
It's Margin Walker the women's man,
The men will have to wait,
(And that's just the same, no?)
She who rang me and passionate and conviced
Me fro about the action:
She says she doesn't see the women in the street,

Though they come dim-eyed and rattled
And almost creased, like the usual wind-blown chickens,
With the odd sensation that they're going to be heard,
And the pleasurable accident
Her hand the sun and her
(Her hand? I say, but what she says
Must not be recorded over newspapers,
Whether she's mad or not,
And whether she's here to see or not:)
Ah, no; she is here to see:
She is in the air, the music is music, she steps
In her bright skirt, and the star with her sings my song,
Or, its phantom resonant still does hold me:
It is the sort of day it is fitting to be mad
To think of being heard, and yet not to be heard:
It is the sort of day it is salty and low
With the dust and the colour of myself,
And the ballad 'round and forgetful
Of the proper bawling and hearing and saying of it over,
======================================== SAMPLE 259 ========================================
Beneath the blackened hemlock-
That she knows how to be,
And beneath the dead arm of Carcassonne

Eternal flames!
That only ever die!
The same great black cloud, the cloud of soot,
That covers the man,
And the horse, and the devil in the dirk,
Then follows after.

What's that that hangs high in the air,
Like a thunder-cloud or like a smoke-hued jack-knife?
And what's all that noise of rain and sleet and snow?
My fingers run o'er the cauls to pluck
A dozen shreds of something that may be
The déknes of birds,--
But there's only rain
And the dogs howling at eve!

And I look and see the top of the Vernalzeak;
And I whisper, "The foot of Debby's lover?"
And my voice doth triumph with a shrill and olden sound,--
"The head of the demon is right down there
'Twixt Agapon down to the well!"

I see her at my window, swooning, red and white-streaked!
And I hear the hysterical "Ah-hah!" and the blood-pink
Of her cheek that's blushing for the dawn of day;
And the bugs that burrowed a-eating her fall then,
And the wolves that broiled upon her!

But I will not cease to pray!
O I do beseech thee, God of my fathers,
That the frost may kill the wolves that killed her,
And a grave may cover her,
And the bleaching grave-dirt may recompute
The crime of her and her lover!

My wolf-skin red and swart,
I'll covers show for her,
E'en at the moorland's side;
And a veil I'll wear for her,
Whose lovely face is fair,
For all the deer and charnel!

Who will give me, who shall receive,
Sweet love,
Mem'ry so complete
In thine own air
That out of it Spring-fern grew
And Violet-violet'd as the Quad-Yew.

I carried a flower
Unto a window where on silk
I laid it by my love-cage in the spring:
Then my love-cage in the spring did part,
And the white rose of the bud did float,
Fragile, useless, on the garden-stream:
But the flower was pure, and wide, and high
As the flower of numberless flowers that roll
From Parthian borders: and a pilgrim house
Bent down its eyes unto my love-cage.

Now, who might have thought ( I mounted the stair
Which over all the bells of my soul did feel)
That in that rose's essence undeearth
Would rise an angel-heart that would on days pour
The blossom-heart of remembrance and of singing,
When round about my love-cage's threshold lay
The mountain-gail, the sea-guls, and the snow
Of northless lands that flecked the crescent feet of heaven?

Come down, soft rain, from cloudless sky,
Coming on earth as on a beached wing
The dead leaves rich plants lift up, and we sweep
Their brief annals in the drifting sun:
While she, within the winds of Spring
That fell on lover's lip and limb,
Lifted freely then upon her gracefully slow
Photos of green ivory, and precious lore
Of many flowers, good of "that noodle,"
In which great phlox and crocus shone
Rich as the glories of fine corn;
And many a thing that Boreas ne'er gifted,
And for which Titan nottlings failed,
With gentle touch through them we touch.

I move me in that rain
To trees that lift their palms to the skies,
Oilding the larch with green
And wool, with clustered fruit,
That wear a pattern like love,
And eyes of flowers that never cry,

Then she that loved me said:
"Sweet, it is time to end this meeting,
For which I have all through nights endured
Still in my heart your breasts at night more staunch,
And every eye I saw was rivetted
To images of you, maiden, where
I almost could have loved you whole and mine.
And it is truly time to cease this,
For where a pine and myzerg's (I'll have your law)
May stand, there's little profit in seeing you,

Each day they are wandering from one purpose
towards another. And a part of you

which, if you are in a position to judge,
you will find, once again, to be nothing but good.

"Relating to Woman", by Linda Rein [The Body, Nature, Social Commentaries, Gender & Sexuality]
So there she is, in her sainted hip
and slippers (and perhaps a redscar, too),
as boutique lingerie shop owner,
prescale amateur voice,
scholar, economist, author,
pickpocket, patriot, consul,
bureaucrat exiled from tax conferences,
speaking circuit,
of flatiron buildings (in her arteries)
the new lesbian economics
we do what we must
because we can,
which means we have to
Which is to say, of flatiron architecture
The paying might make it worthwhile
to leave a quieter, quieter place, like Central Park,
for such concentration,
while the fame fails, the flatiron swagger
makes it worth while
to over-embego the celebrity
of a more private side of herself,
a lady into the sensuous private woman,
unportrified, unadapted to the hero
image, the erotic's hoodlumies
and the hero's signature boots.
The hero's signature boots, of course, are Fleece & Gibbs;
Fleece describes the owner's personality;
Gibbs is the character,
a halogen, a coefficient, a citizen
of both the private self (secured)
and the public self (risk tacked on to secure
Groups I and V). The hero's signature boots,
manic large prognash;
they are small, they shine,
he leaps, he is small
(indexed, he takes it on the left).
Private, he sells (like the hero of this poem)
in the store (as in life), black-owned
lovelier than black, more marketable
than small. He is wise (like the hero's skin
the wise, inclined to the sensual's border)
than marketable, as black, because
the marketable is conflated with the
disproportionate self (threat with the impossible)
while the private self is just the
disproportionately one part of the self
with which he or she is connected.
The private self is inherent in the hero's
skin, just as the marketable is inherent
in the self with which it is connected.
The hero and the private self are thus
circumpolar worlds which reflect each other.
The private self, too, is yet another world
with which it is reflected, and its being
just such a relation
between heroes and heroes,
not only stars
replaced by reflective counterparts,
need to be remembered,
when skin is furious
with lances, not the self,
not just lances
which through the hero's self
may reflect the reflection of self in self.
Self reflects self and so skin
reflects skin. Skin has
no world apart
no vaulted extreme, no higher purpose
no glass divider
no husband who no wife
no mortal boundary
no mortal border
no mummy divock
no future just now
just as it was
no future then
just as
skin no longer
is a world apart
the self no longer
the reflection
on skin
worse than itself
is just
the self skin has
with or without the self
taken or given, or kept, or not;
as in any Pliny Quarantine
as in any Pompeii
the self taken or not is mortal
as any self the self of the world of skin
self no longer self-moved but mortal
self no longer the world of lances
the self mortal
self no longer world
self no longer mortal
self taken or not
self caught up with its own assumption of the world
further, made mortal
further further in a world now further from the self
the self no longer self-moved further in a world now further from the self
skin no longer self-moved;
skin no longer self-moved
self moved self, but self-moved
self no longer self.
No self no self.
The world no self.

We can't help it that we're such am Cares!

Ah, yes, the little romp is done,
And, oh, how slow!
To such a pretty little Late
As never know the Pleasures of Sleep.
It makes me long for Pain,
To see how pale and lukewarm
The evening glooms in their veil;
Oh, that I had my Death,
And seen the spirit's turn,
As up the soul's strange highway
My wandering soul intrepid stray.

I thought of him who died to-day.
We never cease to see each other,
We never cease to love each other;
For, together, without cease,
Thinking of him, I know that he is
With thee, and me, and his favourite
The little child that looks up to him.

No word, no kiss, as custom and care
Keep, till the meal-times over all;
And so he must make known
His week's or month's repast and his task:
It is a thing we must forget
And you must set aside,
As far as I can,
When the meal-times are over.

He must not think of me at all,
But must keep away
From the little lad that looks up to him,
And worries him, as children will gripe
When parents cannot.
That is what Mother must do,
When she thinks of the suffering parent,
I selfish am.

'Tis so very hard to portion
Who should be friends, and who should hate;
Who, since first time that awakes,
Aye yearneth for a touch of his hand
And sees his face, yet yearneth for more.
There is none makes parting less
More easy, but none more painful.

He must set up a roaring
There in the lofty air,
And make his voice sound so clear
And strong in the bird's song, that, did he be not near,
The weak spirit would be troubled.

He must turn all the gross things,
That draw our eyes, away,
And by their lustre make weak:
He must brush away the truth from the mind,
That in things golden puts loss.

He must know the best in what passes,
Or else he would be poor in what is to be;
He that would rise to the highest good
Must trust in what is past, and say ag'in,
'Now I have it once, do this and this.'

The hour that is most opportune
Has no more profit of good things
Than others lost: 'twill not allow
The friend or the lover one dinner-bonfire,
One invitation to the Bier-house,
One trip to tempt the Past with toys.

He must not curse the long day
When others go mad for;
Or seek to weaken the heart's resolve
By town-living in the night:
'That is the one that goes', he says,
'By far most decidedly RARER.'

He must not taken salary
By lying, driving, or going;
But, being IT, and it to itself,
Have what it says and does:
'Tis simple, I know it now, and love it.
No more a figure, but be one.

When the Sin with the Guilty for friend and reward,
Speaks in the starlight interviews, 'Beware
Of the man who goes rewarding,'
She then is not herself in fear:
When the Spring to the lowe that she loves
I saw her weeping in the wild,--
The tears were falling on her Grace's head;
And the air, through her tears she was calling,
Seemed detain'd for her rather than her feet.
'Wherefore weep I, Liz'rato?' she cried;
'Pray why in this weeping?' It was not said


Behind her head a Woman's beauty hid,
And she knelt down in her weeping like a Doe;
'Poor loveless who knows no rest but this,
Why with me the night?
Here 's my head,
Wherein my ears are creeping, anywhere,
For pity's sake, my soother,

My heart ached so that I could hear its pain,
'From my heart, my head!'
'Your heart, my tell me where, my Grace.'
'To fly he, my flying heart,
My speech,
My tongue's middle name.

When the wild wind was only fit to berze
The empty saddle, and the hoofs were lame:

And he, that hath so many times incurred
great scorn among men, was ready to swear
he feared him not. And in the other's
hand his sword was flint, and he, that had
ill-fortune, had his brow enclosed
in a cast long drawn out, and upon
this did groan; and his heart was full of
sorrow, and he smote him and gripped him where
it seemed he had crushed his chest. And he rolled
away, and toward him invoked all the gods
with his long beatels, praying one and other
name, that they might give him back his sight
who was bereft, and besought them to
grant his hated children quick relief, until
they took him home. But when he had snatched
himself from thence, and came into the dust,
the great-hearted duke turned back toward him,
and met his eyes, and spake and hailed him:
whereon Odium with a great cry began
to wail, and utter all the full tale to him,
and thereupon the smiter's wrath grew
like to the dread he had in his heart, and he
with all his sons and goads and followers smote,
and reft from him the said one, while the others
gave no answer save with sighs, and cast
themselves before him as dead, and wept and shouted
and together all smote him, slaying with their
hands out of sight the father and the company
in whose place he sat at table to see if stroke
or bread or wine would be withheld to harm the
wretched sons of the Rapaean.

'Alas, ye wretched, ah me, what land is this
that I see in my dream? The air about it is fouled
by dogs and vultures and birds of prey, so
cursed are they. And there lie rivers and wells
so wasted, and rich wines and harvests and good
viaries. And the men seem the same, the
Scolastic Pirates and harvesers of gold. What, gods,
shall we do to punish them? The sons of Earth
are even in their want, the guileful Perseus
and the faithless Rapelias. No patricide
is mortal in this tit-up, but what she hath lost
she gets back continually. But the day is at hand,
the long beloved day of the daughter of the
earth, of the fair god Apollo, whose bent
arrow smote the terrible manna, bringing
fruit soon; so thou, O seer of all the world where
sinews rulest, stay'st with thy sense, and bid'st
not the harvesters by the turn of Juno's heel her
cinders out of their stake. Thus, even as the
scaly sea now that the broad sun is flamed into
pain can suffer mute, even so, when the long day is
drawn, a voice will go flying all over the
world, calling for strength. And the more
through the tormenting rain it will press upon
it, so long as it afflicteth with rain and snow,

then got together of men all the least of whom

that place was the water of a spring, and the self-same
voice wrought both its light and darkness. And as
yet the pangs were not yet heavy, but durst not
exist, there on the shore, but the water was
filmed on the sand as it were cold, and the burning pain
in both the hands of one whole country were struck in
bitter space.

Does your mind break up with the logic
Of this iron wilderness, and rend
Down its dead banks, as a wind, from off
Its dead tracks?--Because our master Christ
Says never to the upper lighted places
Placed it of the power, the glory, and the
High Excellence of Him who rules
Things to be owned his own? Nay, no,
Let us believe it can be nothing
So high and excellent, but all men
Find low in their true sight. God did say
This Himself, in parables of His heart,
Where if we think, we are unhed, and, if
We believe, then the heart is in the shadow
Of the great stone thrown down at a sound,
Not all our eternal life is in the
Shadow, and the shadow dies out of the
Haunter of the fang. Well now,
The chalice was cleft for the hungry worm
In the guts of the dead brother of Christ;
The heart was the right place for it; and the
heart, the flesh, the rind, are the same,
For love casts out affection.

Had he only his demands made known,
The cost of living, and his own strength to spare,
He could have gotten his own provisions out
And built himself a tomb. And this stone,
Yea, this bloody stone was the right thing
At the end of the steep way to prove it,
And give the world the truth.

If Christus was a Hildebrand,
Because he chose to live in the day,
There is one block head in the whole world
Battling with Hades, and his face
Has not warmed to the forest's peace,
Nor quivered like a reed against the stream.
Stout Branrip hadrew in his veins and skull
Three millers harped millennia ago.
Gosh! they trod forth in the body of Sankara;
They crucified and drained the Caesar,
The world was full when Christus was born;
A miller, carver, force of hand,
This Christus, who was Christ.

That was born with a desire to discover and find
The good he had lost in the ether of His world.

Duty is ours in the thought, the theawless world seen,
Whirled round toward light that leads the ungoverned life to good.
Yea, the most wildest way that I know
To win at any time the winged soul
And that I sing about
Nowise costs you aught.

But to mark you only under the sun
I found it hard to choose
One road that might best be run down.
So here, if you take away nothing else from me,
Take from me the mistakes that I may not hide,
I have been many things to many people, and where many things have upset me; I was wrong about almost all that I did ... and I did not care.
I have hurt others, by omission, by command,
And I have done wrong to myself, and there were many tears that I did not start.

 A sigh,
That breaks in peace.
A half-shut door: that's the way.

In summer weather, sunburned skin,
A hairshirt and a whistle-rock
Suit all ages.
And when summer's gone, the house
Bears on its fools, a litter all.

And the air's alive with straw- That makes you think of snails
And the sound of their gulps.
Like a long-neglected sword, the land
Light dances, it's like a ball;
The sun that's out, the sun that's down
Out of a coat.

If you've a cough,
It's came from the jars.
The hedge-softer's a rake
The weevils a place to pull,
And the trodden fruit makes a bray
And rattle of empty trees.

They bow bewilderred
Like an unfed bare.
They thump like stunted dunces
Or just a mother's tear.
They bawl in high notes.
And their light cries shrink through the trees.

And you remember: such rascals,
Their miry little hearts.
No land could arrest 'em.
They skip and they weave.
They mis-speak, they black-out.
They smoulder in their greed.
They come and they go.

They tell no tale of Earth;
She's unto them a post.
Before the yellow foamy tide
Blows ever back, they'll feel
An end to now and oh,
So free within their waste,
Wet with hot dews, the plain.

And you remember that old fear,
That laid its possessory
Over the house?
Then like a rooming-room they'd be,
And sit and spy and snore
On all thatsts that summer dressed;
The pink that blushed and bloomed and that;
The violet near; the brown in-between,
The mossy green, the pools of green;
And one or two that hung quite light.

I keep a slight host there-above,
And if it's not-away-below
I'll have a hand in the roof,
I could eddy the building-earth with 'em
And bolt the doors of the straightest day
And make a place for a tent
Where two are and two can talk,
And four may walk off and home to be.

Now, I'm a man of the other,
And you call me strange, and I call you lazy;
I am a tree that breeds below thy roots,
Call me old and mean, and then call me barbaric;
I gather and meddle in thine aid and stand
On my own trumpet, and people thy term,
I will not always win thee round, though thou
And call me a likeness,
And tell me that my likeness is not me.
I know not the true me, and thou knowest not
If, by being not so I speak,
By being so thou speak'st, we both seem apart,
Or thou'st knowest thy place, and I the wrong.
And if we stay apart, know well
Thou canst not barter with thy name for mine,
My name for thee, for none without the self is free.

A Muse flying high,
Sat fins all day;
If she would take a lake
She had to follow
Any boat
That came to catch her.

An eagle, long ago,
With plumage grim,
Did confront the sun;
If she would come down
She fell the thing that heads do fall,
On sandy shore.

'Twas done as follows:
She takes a boat that has a page
To guide it;
And the boat vouchsafes no signal for 't,
Till Cliff, near by,
Announce it.

'Twas done by Duncan,
Who standing by
Took anxious care
To tell aught which might aid that statue's
Visage.

And not long after,
Sad Patches came to land
Where Duncan had been.
And though he knew his friend would be there,
And-like a-shape, the face he knew-would not
Unseem the same,
He took his charts from an old and revered book
That had originality outwritten
Poetical claim.

So he to Monkish Tower had made his round,
Driving before him many an unbusy dwarf,
Or anything in store for him.
But when he came to where Brian was lingering
Half reason and half to say farewell,
Patches stopped in his course to state
What he ought to do.

As his being now, that star, though waning, still sets
(If a cloud cover it) with its light to follow:
Thus twixt the last day of that longest days
And this the bard's last year: till he who toils
(To me, from what prospect) all his life from age
May see, here sees, here strikes, this wheel tracks
(In a round) its circuit, with him its course,
With him it sways, in him its motion goes,
In him, while years its course postpones.
So measure the round takes not the round
For graded miles, but in the heart thereof
Truth dwells as in a peaceful bay.

Nor these seven only this day shall'st thou see
In me, composed of mind the best,
Pilgrime to forgive and sin to grapple,
Wherewith sullied doubly, yet shall soft
The league resolvèd to his law observèd,
Nor that, which joynè, hath half mused, so close
His nature and his nature comforts him.
Besides, this yesternight, for them in error
Who fell, who did for sin call stars Friday:
My brother, all for that transgression lost, as began
On that same day, that on this hill lay crippled,
I did for moss my mantle and gown; and, as
At that same time a sign we are both of all,
For all that hath been or is, if it occurred, is or was,
The same thing is in memory of each with us, and each,
Since time begins not with Death, but Time, shall be:
And for those laws that things continue as they are,
I see no cause why those same laws, which now divide
The remaining universe, should not mark it as full
Of pathless air, where Ideas are;
For every life, after its own fashion run,
Illustrates that life's torch light is well spent:
As scorch'd smoke, after fire has struck the eye
Full down the infernal side.
But grieve you not so, for death emblazon'd must
These ears and this head of thine forever;
And grief shall be, as fire, endurable, true,
And I and thou unhappy, as before.
But love and joy, such love as nothing can
Fly from thy wrath; and such joy as nothing can
Be seems when gods their transitions do adore,
Such shall be, such is, yet shall be no more
Than blind day star madness; all things in chaos mind
Lasting, rouse through word, chart, or section, from all
That camels' shadows from the hills have rear'd their lighting course.
No eye, no more than mouth can make them vain.
The mouth is wither'd; and, as flowers, shall be
His brain, and twilome; and as the mouth, the heart,
The brain and all its parts for ever deceiv'd;
That all their substance and concept is transfement;
Creation, no less, of a whole in all;
Much Life, much Death; both leave and new Collapse;
And this (when thou dost not object to it) thy new Brain.
Ev'n (said I) to misfortunes I beheaf,
To wretchedness under bliss depending.
So ends, my Secret; and thus the Vision rose.

All leaves, all solidays, farewell! that can
For earth, be everywhere right.
Such transient breathings, such the names we make
Of living things, earthly where we dwell:
Alas! not even murmur less can fright
Into frigend sleep, than such a horror
As floating Death, such fair suff'rings we
Trust to Sleep's couloirs, and on we go!

Jasper Black, Captain of the Guards,--
a lover of horses, and a tinkerman
to the king,--to him was given the fiddle,
to whom he blew so beautiful wild notes
that it often seemed the king, and not the fiddler,
was standing here in the bright, snowy hall.
He too, as Captain Macgregor told me, was heir
to all the glory of Windsor, and by right
the castle--though soon to be torn down,
and the great forest of Windsor overgrown--
was his through a prince of Wales, and his nephew through
Lancelot, King of Scotland; for Jasper was heir
by affinity of birth.

and the second star was always the Moon,
always heralding rest.
It was a beautiful star, and full of dreams
and beauty, for it burned in the depths of the sky,
like the white lamp of the twilight, bright through
and in the blue air.

I stare at the portrait of Sir Johnless,
there are no women in his line--
He loved the old knot of a-trim--and a-glow,
a-soaling, a-hunting.
Though he was born in the sounding sun
Into the quiet evening
There were no images of him posing
for his chiselled stick and belt,

And he walked among the solitare
with a delight for the beatific rays

Of rime and riddling and sand and sky.
For these are the pictures in man,
painting which the books all tell us
There was no place in the world

For all these pleasures.
He was swallowed up in the tiniest theories
of the growths he noticed and touched.
For a moment in the stillness
Unarmed and unafraid
He held communion with the Book of Heaven

And he heard the breath of the Prophets.
It was the ecstasy of the brute.
He heard the big boa come down

From the sky and the mountain and the lake.
The big boa loved Sir John like a brother,

And the same is the snake you must shun.

He heard the heavy tread and Zodiac
and the world from the beginning.
For the rest,
The brutes have heard the same.
And the wise men--and they have it just

For the bird that plumed him the job is a wonder

To make a hummingbird's bale.
He talked about the zodiac

And the heavenly pole and ascents
On charts, and the cosmic tears,
And the dream and the evangeline.
He would have accepted Aquilinos
as Es, if he had been so lucky,

But the pilgrims not yet cleared the palace,
and he was bound to stay.

The proud men all smirk at the boa.
The docile eat the webby-web.

Something is even as all the rest.
It comes at me as an approach-and-readies.
I tap the air and tap the palm

As if it had a rack you poked my belly

As if a will to live, it tries
its tough old teeth in mine.
It tries to identify.
It laughs.
It thinks it's remembering me.

The tall clouds move you.

You go to your home through a gap

Howe'er you look,
A dragon of flame
Flies by on his hind-legs.

That which most noisome is
The light bark dark maw,
That no eye can tolerate
Nor ears no pleasure.
The barking of the mad dog
Ascends from its dungeon,
The small rockets' cries
Scare the flaut of a mill-stone
A good deal.

The woman and the man
Nought care in heaven
To hear the more of God;
Distant voices nought esteem,
But the voice 's audio-visual.
The woman and man seem mad,
A big gun beneath the bed
Is the long-slugged tyrant,
And the nailer's breath is taken.

Where my girls gone in the car,
Hear I how my new craze
Comes to our caste of dogs.
As I rattle on my pedest,
Hear I the chorus' response.
And, behold, my science,
A question of how I live.

The bewilder'd and awkward,
The furrow'd and cramped rout,
The boggle-faced, and the glower'd,
Hear I their nature lecture.
Rear'd in velvet inky,
How dim they see and can't speak.
My stiff-prone scribes my thought
On a guess that most guess wrong.

Where she has passed from heel
To the ruffled heel a space

And is it claim'd your right

And rabs on rafter,
But trade goes up and down.

He looks in face a storekeeper,

In hollow hells and wells,
All wizzen, all right,
All briny deep.

A dead end rides the lot of the one that drew
The other's breath:
Or waiting a gas-lit turn at the fitting-greasely hole,
They seethe o'er the bluing of horning their quarter block's blackness
(As black is their cham-pudding, I wisel-blub:
With quiche-dust they lookin').

You'll know what gas-lighter's done to my breeches,
And my bad leg's foot-stiffening,
'Cause you seen my men on the sloped roof of the pit
A-Slime on the slaked flume,
Climpin to the roll of the mishap to see' what the wretch is a-deep,
And my legs to sag.

The lookers-like have a-Silentretiring in that colourless
Bleed that lies me on Kangaroo Court,
By ane that's my Annihilatress.

Since the road he should not quit;
For the frozen heart to rock again
The tide of life must flow away.
The past is in dust, and all that stood
The piles of ice its powdery shroud dust.
While 'tis but right to live on his love,
The love that he in the past did claim.
And the present is a fleeting thing,
That in the depths of his regret shall sleep.

Well, since she's lovely, we'll say
He was not wholly wrong to live on,
Nor find a liquid mirror'd cheer,
In the wintry turret like a snow-drift.
To live by thieving, and to pile
The odour of snow on his hands,
And turn the salt world into a stove
The smoke from one brand of frank-thylacid
He was wont to take, and throw away
On rocks that quickened with the burn,
That speedily were mended, and then
He burned out, and she began
To educate in science and law,
In science little knowin';
But she became (she's the mother now)
A check to what she should have been.
She plaisted with no qualms, and ran
A nasty boarding-school;
Broke all the lessenkens; and did fine
To cheat by a Regent's Luding;
And gave the British regent's a kind
Of institution to the race
(Tho' some strong private-latrine were made),
To squat in, and hold his senses sound,
Against the menace of an angry State.
Where are your public checks?
They're everywhere.  There is no check,
No slightest bar to platinum manias.
The Banker keeps his hot hand on the plancin;
The Corpiner keeps the spouts a-gclear;
The drunkard wins his selfish unanimously;
The free-loader ngiver, and fills his cup
With popular favours ding-dong strong,
And cold-water kindness to the settin;
The drinker, when it's out of sight, lies in
The medium size between a coxcomb and snob;

What's this we drink so freely of? tea-lime
Mango-compote with its sauce semi-poong,
Or chiliie, half-learned, half-murder;
We're no gauchevit lunchers; for that
Leads to the kadi-tangle of Y. bore
(In the dust-patch lower, where our feet were)
And we're back let go, and none higher raised;
Ourselves we need no stretch to be.

Now that we've paid the sects to come to us,
(Our fortunes are now to little known);
And that black-leg contingent
Hasn't contrived to make us double hot,
We shall be hungry at that concoction
So intensely sweet to contemplate
The Ragged Troubadour's astonishing means:
The kadi (learned theolog with less repute)
Makes tincture that "it's only true to say

(My) belly full to stay);
But it's of such fruit we lewdly incline
(We are so anxious to be extorted);
And if it be wrong, it's no longer in the scale
For us to weigh; we've no excuse for the habit;
That which is right nor bound by any State law
We can call up of old (although we're reprieved);
Or we can thank thick Brisbane Darkness
For this extraordinary cognition.

What concern's their modest fief'?
And to them besides, to say it over,

But so what's the heat?)
And further, I've heard that one poor beast
Said 'twas a good old Anglican Priest was slandered.

How fully he stays at nijf lef;
And sweetly proves the coming of the light, too,
When the moonshine pours from the spaurenders bright.)

He had made, poor devil, two fine nymphs
To be his earthly minstrels but fiercer,
(I mean of his breast a lovely cheezeett,
And a starveling to sing all day in bed,
And when fresh from his mate with lightning bright,
To go in the morning with him and bid me bed,)
Only to sleep with him at night to greet the sun,

Is riven by the hand of her
Who, or no immemorial beauty's spell
Wherein by grief-struck eyes and vainly grey
The broken mirror shine through tear-blurred glass;
It is the weeping of the eyes
Of him, and him alone, who first
Made all her soul's awful comfort take
An image more divine and more
Real than beauty in her tears.

Such is the queen of kings; she
Among the shimmering airs of light
Where the many fashions of the sky
Melt and sublimate in the wind
Beats into flame the image blown from her
So real that men may look on
And follow after her gaze,
And one another, and see afar
The shapeliness of limbs and hair
And gaze her hellenicness.

What calls the king to the masque of earth
More than the queen of night? The queen
Is of more beauty than the lights
That make so beautiful the sky
That men may look upon the path
To her drowned city and say,
Behold, we have not seen her eyes;
Thus guarded, henceforth she may go
Forward with a jubilant look
From men's eyes made dim by sin,
To that great darkness whereat they see
Only the unreality.

The queen of night is beauty.
Abandoned by the sun,
Siete, she is here
On this dark and fierce earth,
Withering like a southern star
That warms on a winter night.
Yea, he that loves her,
Love her, and mourn him not
Because she is so;
Let him light his lamp
And look on her great face
And know his sin in a moment is dead.

If it be so fair to look upon,
Is not the worldría deona
Light so fair to my sight
(Fixt and unfixed) though it be
Dreadful to speak it at?
Great art thou, O Spirits!
To keep and quicken what great God
Made so beautiful that like
All life that God creates, it is now
Beautiful, even this.

But the queen of light is like the day,
Like the day, it is so fair to see;
It breaks into the clergy's pipe
Like the crack of doom.
All love it, and almost all love it commands
That nothing better is than love.
Love that brings fear,
Fortune, love, life, and love,
If it bring the end or end,
Lights with its least word the helpless earth.
If its first pulse be to bless,
If the last to wildest is still wilder,
Speaks the sweet love of it, and breathless

Oh, love is sweet,
If the soft walls of its guarded well
Keep its honey still;
If the sweet watering of its rill
On the plains be free;
If the bee hum through the thicket all the day
And the loquacious bee
Find its fullest peace on the honey-dome.

On the day it falls, the day it falls
From its mad-in-mid-siege cathedral,
Oh, it drips and drips in sanguine tide
Above its own eclipse;
Yet the crowned heads of all its family
Spin on, and lift their hands, and turn
To claim it drunkenness up.

Dawn breaks on the frosty north,
And the frost-dragon's clang
Makes the deep earth chill beyond the day,
And the dawn is on the rolling sea,
But not an hour too soon.
An hour too soon.
An hour too soon.
But the sun alone be found,
Uncheered and bare,
Unhospitable, and past
Laughter and deep-lung'd sound.

Why should the revel start
So suddenly on their toe?
(A rumpler type than ours)
Ay, but to watch their gait
In pokers, without a gagric, knowing
How fast they're hastening the last mile.
That sort of men love;
Their sex was everywhere
Swinging 'em in a fashionable sock,
Knowing it a shoe that's only fit
Through the backs provided,
And the fashion of their fumbling to get in,
And the ready falseness of their getting there,
And their indifference to the image
Of a healthful pair of legs,
And the loockered speed with which they walk,
And their idea that all beauty's round,
That all music's pulse,
That all passion's friction,
That's easy and a pleasure for a few.

Than have a choicer flavour,--nor figs
That have a delicate taste.

What is it to me,
That sweetly breathe,
A few paces off,
Beyond the depth
Where figs are to be found?

Even and sorrowful
The hours they steal,
Which I can never know
Sad, or sweet,
Without pitying every sound.

But the night must come,
And break these hours
Which seem to me so sweet,
Or if detain'd
Should some thought in my breast assail,
They will have then no power
Which to disarray,
My grief to feel.

Faults of face which you see
The light can't remove;
The sunshine may accord
With all I've built so high,
But the last spirit love can change
Itself into despair.

Or if I sleep, and rue
This image of grief,
It's like a dream,
And we need look no more on't,
My faith can but increase.
This is the end of hope.

Only three things I have in mind,
When setting out to sing this song.
The first is the true cause of this tune;
The second is the very moon
Whose name is sorrow, loss, and spy.
The third is a noble affair
All swept away from me
By the woe it has done great wrong
To me, blinded by the shame of it.

The true cause of this tune I have to name:
The girl I sung of Mark and Joan
Who said as much as she could do,
I will treble it and double it.
And what is the fourth, let me decide.
I.e., the Baron of Cold nigh nigh
In Germany.

As to those three things I have in mind
There are two ways: (a crowner for both)
I can tell you as both are, or as they are not.
As they are. They are these three:--
1. As they can be for two.
2. As I did them then or when I saw they could not do so
3. As they must do so for evermore.

I never care at a goal
If someone puts rubies there,
So he comes to me with his violets
And he gives one to you,
You grate them and I to grate them,
As you grate the rest, a little.
But the crown will be too small a gilding
If I lend you one rubie.

Good night, I want to say to brother Mark
What do you suppose he meant by that?
What was it he said about lovers?
That there are none like them, gold and love,
Except some pure treasurers of an interior life,
And as we find no joy in doing this,
It follows that no man might find them
As we do in loving doing.

Mark looks down to Emma, but you can see
She's heard a pastor in that biro of his,
And her thought is, "If there is no God but man is God,
Then all the truth in me is told for them,
And he who loves with loneliness does so
Because he is alone."

The rose has wet its blade and Dr. Cox's work is free to begin.
His little parlor we put the cud on, so that the Goddess no more interferes.
For ten years the parlor has been a tomb, and now for eight
He has taken his ease when he has taken his fare.
Now we may think his calmest utterance, and we may be sure
It is not forced, for the awful as yet is the least.
We do not believe him--that is, we hope he hasn't at this
famishing found the daily feed of peace.

That is one grown up argument in favour of Christ.
And, as for me, I plucked a leaf of mortal virtue
From a less than salted garden of my thoughts,
And made the whole Christian household table enough,
So that the Rose may rouse the omniscient voice
That says my soul a beast is set for this insertion.
I can think no possible explanation quite alone
Save as a man of flour," and then ask:
"Is it necessary?"

A bearded man with a horn at his chin,
And one eye open like a chicken-rib,
(Donne's phrase), came through the door and stood looking at us.
"I, J. N.J. 2d. 12 sp."
(The 12d. value is the common one,)
I wish to purchase,
======================================== SAMPLE 272 ========================================
This marvellous blackness gave him a night
All his own. And by the marge he drew
Of black and white dogwood, giving drink
To the roses sleeping under their own shadows;
And he could swear he saw it, one pale face
Along the road, among them, white and ghostly,
Like a drowned face that came to light in some vale.
And he thought, "When I grow older, I'll know
And love the more the days when they'll be:
I'll say what roses in my garden grow."
But by the time he reached his thirteenth year
Doom had passed, and he was not there.
And now, with twilight shades and stars and white,
All round him sleeping and waking, he thought
Only of his lost, his marvellous self.
"I'll love my sister better," he said,
"In her blue house beside the dark,"--
And silence was all the answer he got.

For every day that brought no new occasion,
Or nearness, or help, or distance,
AYKUTSA USED TO tell the same small war
IN WHATE'ERISTICALLY mounted stranger.
Blessings, terrors. Grief to want and feed,
REGRETS what. Wistful doubts of the groom,--
Promises to dinner guests ten times her age.
Winds accused, laughter at unexpected star.
Regrets that gold determines mirrors
In at least THREE DECADES older trees.
Regrets those talks so strangely strayed,

That WILLIAM'S LOVE-ME-YOUR GOD now only known
For miraculous reluctance
(Deliberate delay) on EVERY other girl
In the SIXTY-FIVE shone that night.
Regrets--and these made small by his mien--
The pass she did not grant at first.
Regrets that strife alone FINALLY works
Youth's place in TIME'S blue republic of man.

A springtide story, something for SULTAN Saddam
To mull and stroke! and still retain in stride.
And to the absent still such shape eminently
Daunting to architecture--the smile of bushels,
Or the light blue that wit sets in a sty.

Under the sod at Hartford, where it finally meets
The Illinois Central, again at Chicago's O'HARE,
It is permitted to feel at times the habit good
Of two thousand miles more than averaging two
Since sun-up and sun-down don't crosshand.

Dung borne directly from Oklahoma, a whole
If taken alive and put on the table! with it,
The plunder of a dozen Mexican Verses.
At this point it is worth while to sift the grain.
Malt extract, glycerine, turpentine, and chalk.
And for the Kansas native's fair case, we turn
To the mix really made in the brandy jar.

For two months we hear nothing. Then, justthen, hearing
All about the dust at CENN RO, a press dust,
All American products, a chamber ball.
And pass up the hula with the Midwestern bar,
And pass with the eagles and playing cards, and CENN RO.

The "glorious" crime, as we title the thing most of all,
At which all others bar one naming a drink,
Is listed the most by the Imperial House
Of this character taken at Frederictor's Circus.
Makes the list every time it is dreamt of, you know.
And for the police, the dream it is that doesn't mean a thing.

And now the flowers, which we shall look forward to,
Turned all in the mother of pearl base.
I said am a great fan of the preseason.
And so I am brought at it by nothing but.
For it's the guide line, Montgomry, under date logique.

And what about the flowers? they fade, in the powder air.
They should be like the hearts in that old basket of mine,
The one I dismantled the plug from, to install.
They never ought to have ceased to, but they haven't.
They don't really look like they wanted to though.

And what if they have? Nothing. They won't.
This is purple with a heart of lead.
And I don't care. I mean, who cares?
We will none of us care, this enchanting night.
All we have to do is simply allow it to be,
To walk around, madcap, breathless, love profane,
In vain hope, in vain joy, in vain innocence.

All that is bad is only like something I made up
======================================== SAMPLE 273 ========================================
Parameter of my fear and horror,
A curse upon my lips! A curse
Upon my brow, and all alone!

Mother! O mother! wet-nurse dear,
Do not weep so bitterly.
Go not to-day your daily rounds,
Nor waste your years away in weeping;
Go, where the red rising sun will guide,
Go, where the wild-wing'd dove will oahhh,
To where the otter lays her eggs;

Where hov'ring trunks the tulip-trees shade,
Where scents of earth and coastal vapour blow,
And gossips new-formed cherry moons arise,
And fays who walk with women meet.
All this do, as now do, my stag,
And in this canny business sit.
Thus Venus keeps the same with him:
So do Lamé's twins, so do all
The dancing serpents know of She.
But this good thing in your eye let fall
On your flower-blossoms and your daisies,
That all that is green and flow'ry bier
You may color with bright eye-glories
You for your mother's face.
Color is light.
Light is darkness.
Color is light.
See how the waves of morning rush
With the new-risen suns till they be
Washed by the countless hours of light
Out of the mother's eye.
And yet you are not an eye,
But only a dark eye turned out
To find a way by the light.
Color is well, but look through no eyes:
Let it stand as it was far,
And all the house of your seeing
Sink slowly down into the night.
Color is dust, but Color is Light.
And where there is no Light, there is
Nothing for the eye to follow.
Color is soft in the clay:
A clay that holds the earth in trust
And so the color of the earth
Has a comfort; but see:
There is a BEARD in the Dawn:
It is the color of the earth
And the judge of what is collosal.
Now I will put you to bed
Because you try to see in the dawn
Things that are not there to be seen by day.
You are not to be disturb'd by the dawn:
It is a pledge from your side
Of a jubilant promise: beware
Of thoughts that are not in your sight.
Minds that are moving but appear.
In the river Poet who is he?
No, not he: so small, so poor:
You would not take him as a friend.
He is not here this morning:
When I was working at the morning star
I saw he was shining still:
Not the jostling little shoes of men
On the blue shadow-land of the sea,
Nor a jingle in the street of the ring
Where a gowned colour is break'd down:
Not the white wing'd flying-preecha
Flying over the spumed grains:
Nor the white feet of the morning feet
That sound back from the pavement Old Town Hall
One moment, where the bits of the sun are thrown:
Nor the sudden flash of the water-phonograph
As the gaudiosponda's door ajar:
Nor the requiems, the pilgrim-tapes,
That are fall'n over the topmost thorpeshanner
As the dusk enfilades the hill:
Nor yet the soul that calls o'er the break'ning walls
Of the dark future, when the roofs of the city
Extend their beams into pearly eagles' eyes;
When the walls themselves are turn'd into lamps for nights
To illumine a hour, and a day, and a year,
Till the light that they lived in twelve years is become
A quenchless fire, and the past meal stayeth well charg'd;
Ay! only till thine eyes, unhappy vessel, behold
A light upon the water which gods and sages hold.
There is a light upon the beach:  a moonless moon
That is neither next day nor yet future day,
But is both a part of all which days and years are:
She is not fair to all, she is not black,
There is a brown woman, that is lover to me!

This I may know:  and this I know full well,
That an Interview between love and me
Would end and all proper enjoyment as thou seest:
That to be so, would the Sole Living Idee
Of the interview so facetiouss, should be
Should make profligacy of our meeting:
That I would not change from thisoty rocke for feck,

her moods like words, an English spare
or a woman on the edge, her grip

as if the nature of the river
of fury, of control,
as if it were all an illusion, each
contraction just a moment

of the bigger picture
of what it means to be human

and, in that larger scheme,
to act it out, and each
collapse a moment
into the other, which was last night
the ground I slept in.

4.
The boy, the trip, the bologna sandwich.
You must get tired, at some point,
so I holler up to the neighbors down the road
where they spend their days chopping plastic swag
and spitting it out on a main street where
all their money goes.
I don't care if the girl is damn near as awful
as she's beyond incredible, and I'm ready to blow
her head off if she so much as twitches
left on her lips, and the boy is me, and so am I,
and we're not even at the part where I pretend
I'd like to do her dirty work

if she so will.

5.
There is a long, small mountain
across my shoulder, and I can see it from here
across the highway, and I can see it
across the highway, and I can see it

from the room where I'm watching
the boy and his unfriended friends
playing his favorite game of tag,

of tag, of tag, across the field
where his new BFFs and his new

boyfriend's new BFFs
stand together for a movie
night the two have made about their
favorite scary horror movies

where the boy confesses his love
and the boy's best friend, who is
not a BFF, gives up his best
friend for dead each game.

That's the part where I get to be
just one of the boys.

I'd lie around the house on the floor,
deliberately kicking a baby
or two, or wander out onto the deck
of my childhood's terror, the interstate
whose deserts I am doomed to make

a particular geography, the part where
we dress up as cowboys and kidnapped
brides and head out west with never a wage

in the offing and are sent around various
other kids on whom we've given vague
confessions, mini-confederates, to wander
west through mozzarella, arroyo, light

tribal when the weather looks like
the weather of Rome, West Mexico,
Saraweland, north Idaho, toward
the Hasla for a while then on toward
Los Angeles, a maze so maze
you get the feeling you could tore
intricate by order of application
and be present in more than fifty
counties and more than fifty
worldlets and not get bored unless
there's an after morrow, a situation
in which it becomes clear that you've still
got some dozen or more terrific blondes wanting
to talk about you in the same room,
after you're fed and watered and show up
dressed like your best friend, or your
hip, perceived legal husband, not
guilty of any of the single crimes
medics declare have criminal
impact. In this sense you're
not even disagreeing with me;
there's a sense in which I Am Myself
through the sense in which I am Your
Unseen Camera. That's how
the Days dissolve. If you're an actress
proud and able to react to your own
statistic, you're a star. If
you're not proud and not able, you're not
reconceived and not under test, then
too often you're the whelmed frog
or the little bee or the vertebrae
of your real life, alongside the chips
of yourself you calleroused and forgot
where to call. The fact is,
if you're not your brother's daughter or
your biological daughter, you're not in position
to be heard adequately to request,
unarmed, a just retribution. So:
there was the real danger of you, a girl
on the cusp of twelve in your thirty-
five memory, and you close your
eyes to be born, in your inchoate birth-lot
or story, and there you spend your time,
a little short of son, a little
short of daughter, that you never will know
how to find. And the laws of probability
call for minstrelshifts and breath studies,
with your hands by the edge of the bed,
your hair layed over your shoe-tent, blue
as tendrils of night, the world
======================================== SAMPLE 275 ========================================
Generally this may be a danger to the ever-troubled,
The little boy may have a hard time for a few days,
For he will not understand a sentence that was not said,
He never will catch a tramp, or be in the right place at the right time.

The city birds, in the pocket-book
Their American and foreign flags, wrap around their backs.
They then commence their warble pidgin,
of street-food or rather their love-lays,
For they mean most of their benevo-rite
As amusement to the locals and passers-by.

I do not think this bare nothing of a tune
Should be condemned or condemned harshly,
A touch of the amorous sour to sear the thist heart,
A touch of Justice, to do a villain in your eyes,
For I never can agree to a hero nor a bully.

He did as he pleased when the boys were out of town,
So he called in his Jills and his County Councils and all his lawyers
And began to organize all the little things that he could
By which he might causes and bursts of triumph contribute.

He made himself a man
Without any second thought,
Who did right by common-wealths good.
And his touch was the stroke of the devilish art
That grieves but cannot blame in the end.

When a Chief was a Chief was a Chief,
Without you or me he knew the job was done;
And the outposts they could not restrain him,
He was laying seed in the desert of his times;
And the mountains he dared to climb were victorious.

I thought I'd like to see him cutting off
soggarthoted heels
And handing round wharen't your being's confirmed in gold,
And you being a wallflower, stooping, with your gloves in your back.
And you being a tiny parrot wishing to be nothing great.

Or maybe I'm going to be some vast coward,
A vanishing coward, going whirl for whirl
For my wasted years and whoever's next in the rez,
And the farewells they say waiting to save me from myself.

Perhaps, oh well-written stories in the autumn I've put down,
Such as the world turns supine with its vermouth-red mouth,
Whose wit's coked there to do no justice to the subject;
Such as the world turns supine with its onyx mouth,
Such whose causing the topmost notice is to deny me.

Some will kiss my hand, saying it's meet,
But when I ask for a half-pennyworth of cupavaws,
Saying it's not owing but just over
Beneath my hand they flee like any drum.
I ask not what their skill or tossing know,
Only what is their ever-youthful lark.

You've the picturesque, and the other you
Brag but love the power of reaching the sky,
Shooting your light qualification
Above the world that you may remind me
Where of direction I may but know not.
You heavy now that don't understand!
O artistic and harsh but trustworthy psychologist!

Though fire may burn I'll hold you both my
Islands to the citizens of Maui,
You're lighter than leaves and shall be taken.

Just a dream—
But I wasn't of two
Head to spare to tattle
Just a dream—
A cool evening on
Our sea and our own,
Horses at the shelf,
Piece of toffee
To squeeze
In our own cups,
Just a cool
Toreadoo
By the herdsman's cave,
Just a dream.

Of no one fond,
Just a cool
To the best of us,
Just a dream
That we dreamed
Never to reanimate,
Just a set
Of wooden guns
In the fields of our own.

20th Anniversary Volume, The Serpent's Skin

Just a dream.
I was in a wood—a place I had often gone to,
The green and alder-scented, dark and deep.
There I saw a corpse with its shirt unclipped; and when
I took a body down from that awning, it was a dead man—
A dead man, all of hair, mild eyes brown as marigolds,
His hands were open in a stiff hand, and stript flesh stood

======================================== SAMPLE 276 ========================================
ers, but each seemed of the seeds of snakes
That did enmantle rocks and trees and nations.
And Pandy of the maddened penny
Was the true writer of verse, but his satires
Were the stuff of which our poets are made;
He alone of all the rest by force or cunning
Eliminated all the fox in him and restored
The beauty of the lamb to the fold.  Look at
His prime of accomplices,--look on the seed
Of the false accuser,--look on the dog in piece
That helped to cook the verbis vocarent;
Look on the king, and note his keeper, and tell
'Were it impossible, I would believe'--
Is it?  Why, a sceptre would go still deeper.

The king of all spotless truth and brightness
Is more intensely serene when he sees
His art applied to a redeeming use;
For him, too, the horns of experience glow,
Which proclaim the universal pain,
The universal derision, the blot
That comes from nature when she fashions self
And discounts the thing she derives from it.

His constant thought is the enjoyment
Of those who love him; for his art distracts
Her current of thought and increase her passion;
For his zeal burns thought and investigation,
And feed his hopes as the flames discover
The seeds of beauty and exalt him past
The bounds of his old labours.  He is innocent;
She who believes her mind with wisdom moves on strong
Innocence and fancy, are the builders of empires.

He is as one born to be prime matter,
To be immersed in the bound of his own idea,
And to smear with the hues he will to gales; he
Can be to colours in special aired and dowered
To such a hue as will make the excursions
Of the star-winged observation dazzle.
He is as well made for contemplation
As any living limb that's given to view,
His is the bowane of the spangled sky,
The cartwheel of the chariot of the heavens.

His is the fine art of obeying the world,
And then running faster than before; his
Is fear to observe and courage in the crowd;
He will be found the true servant of his plan
When all is said, because he was true when he thought.
He is a clerk in a laundry, and that's well enough,
And when they insist on seeing him any way
He hie to some plain of sight or colourful hill
That looks into a wonderland, and looks
At the green and gold of woods and the red of brooks;
He looks to the small or lofty folk to whom he speaks,
And looks "The British Constitution" and "Michigan,"
And looks at the outer limits of the human mind,
And so purchases, too,--at a discount "the land
In Indiana"--and looks at the upland farm
Where he can farmer's fortune retisestate try.

His is the guileful eye that tricks our truth
And steals the price of the ounce of gold we feel.
His the thecheered cheek that sleeps and gluts under lids
With arched backs and tulip teeth; and his
Sarcenet, with the esmetial eyne of a girlish thirst.
Feebly to tire out ev'ry acceptable object,
But by sad refinement, we join under pain
His robe,--as he leaves us, never more employed,
For fresh disasters to join, and rheum its floods;
And lend him our joint power to add to his store,
And see him all time, all space, mong strange tricks succeed;
Rich in ourselves, rich in him, and all time.

Whilst he the woods and tempests drives like Juno's power,
Or like the voice made by the strife of wind and rain,
Whilst he, to sundry cities, goes, unpesecious,
Our pulses at first quail, and tremble at the sight
Of him, like him, born to huge disaster,
Whose gaiters he, on our coast, we await
At east,--who, like the companions of the dead,
Shall wander without a side from where he found a home.

Who, like the companions of the dead, shall wander without a goal.
Who, like the companions of the dead, shall watch the winds
Their wonted prow, and look beyond the seas, and pry
The moon offline, and hack their way to ground?
Whose fingers are elastic, as platinum, and fall
Into chalgenite and twilinning and smooth to ye eye.

 first
Take care that the pinions be not covered
With galls of chafe, that the eye of the day
Shine not on them. And thou who com'st
To gaze upon this pinion, brace thyself
Up close about thy shoulders, and press
Deeply thy breast, and turn all thy life
To the place where he will.  The longer
That thou dost this, the more will be its weight
Upon thy dreams.  O, if thou canst get
Free down within this place, and yet be
 Aware of it, tell me, and tell
The name whereby I may know him.

All names have I for thee--the one, the prime,
But thou art something less than all.
Namœcia, the name of God, that is not bound
To any one life; and, far as it can,
Setting out from naught, say, a thousand
From all calendars, shows itself
TOWARDS the now shining sun.  All senses,
All times, all depths, have at times renounced
The self-popular life of stars, and fall
When now their cycles put an end to all.
When I show thee that face, all this hath ben
Done to the full, and naught beside
To count as a light thing come from darkness.
The name that like a ringing brass bell doth
Resemble, is house-held by its lord,
And so by many is this one's prize
Depposted far from every iotricitic.
But this thou knowest as having lost
Memory thereof, only as yet
The likener, name, was not thy labour
In that large fruitless tree, that grew so thick
Whose leaves, like to their seraphical
Ribbons, like in glory, and their tops
Like feather-crowned cherubim, and eyes
Were filled with rays, not get and fewer put
In their dewy head; the leaves were made
Of radiant gold, and redolent with flowers
No more for hardly touching, more for love
Of looking than for any great desire,
But so inseason with one another
That one made the other his aide and joy.
Nay, more my brother, any man may call
And hear his name, any place and time
And time the name; but O such pronunciations
Make hands impotent of touching hands.
All names, or ways, all places, and all times,
I say, and yet I know me not,
So shalt thou be a shadow until my death.
This sun which makes the world my treasure
Yielding me warmth when it will, and power
To distance far and wide where I will,
And make or mar all crosses when I can,
This sun will I not see between me and it,
But take possession of the same by turn
But different from its time and place?  Error,
I see; but why in heaven?  If one day's
Not time, one world, if death not break my sun
Before I get mine back, no man can go
From God over many lives, or live
Longer, while one sun rich-made keeps his golden
ButTitions in the cuckoo-stable of Apollo.

But now, what Sun, that ever had help
With lifting fire, did I see girt with light
Freely to shine on beings for the best
And clearest knowledge of the ways to act,
And but not ineffable trust in its actions,
Its fire for helping and for reproving?
Who caught the fire and whoso gave it
Into laws and teachings, such as made
The highest Heavens ring yet till we return
For instruction, and all things that are

This light of law in description vast,
The poetry and friend of life,
And flower of God in fancy, this,, the father
Of all new birth, not in today's best,
Nor what this or that we call, with better grace
And discharge from terrible troubles borne,
This light we feel, this fire of order new,
This heaven-like fire of order bright, we hold
In trust for our salvation, and put away
All that escapes not governed by it alone,
Nor lives untwisting from its way.  Not
The suns, perhaps, the gods or the seasons will
Or needs will draw fresh birth or country from us
Or give their grace, but in its doing so much.

And from this virtue, chiefs, do not teens wait,
Are not the gifts you forget, the young
Or old, not always what you think, is gracious
And to be used.  You do your policy,
Then best to me!

 "Great art thou, O Pallas!"--Thenceforth the twain break brief,
And gather fast, that are of Pallas' train.

As in his house the elms were hammers
Where mighty Vulcan first his son
Caucase, ere gods recognized,
The mighty work of Vulcan's hand,
The bronze-hilted cauldrons won
Against the neighboring elms. Now he
Made the great hammer of his thoughts;
And all the Titanes saw, and harked;
"Caucase! Caucase!"--And, even at that,
"The gods," as by the First they heard,
"Be naught but thine and yours."  So passed
The years of that first father-stock,
So thither they return,
Concealing their glorious youth and wonted might
By waning life-frames, till in dalliance
Postponing until the conclusion
Of some-verse, at their house they lingered,
That, having slain an hundred men,
With abundant wine to the gods they should go.

But when at last, as it befel, the day
Was subdued to them, and they had done
 What they had done, and oft they tried
And spake with dying sounds, yet invited
This caw-crow, "Caucase," calls the gods,
"Caucase," calls he the enchanted warriors
To the same stale, and calls the bidden clowns
To laughter unafraid.  Then with a mighty rush
Tower'd Helyca, and the sea o'erwhelm'd
Flame wind-scathed, and drave the foam-cliffs arrester,
Bristle the bays, and sandy hilles riven,
Alive, with fire, and dead so soon were dearer than life.

But on the sacred day the silent gods withdrew,
Lest awful Ulysses offended with gold
Should take his wrath, when late had ado
By the wise tortoise Ganymede upraised
The word's end from the bonniest hawk that ever wore
(That ever wore, that ever tanned were young)
Upwrach'd with heat, to render back, to fetch
And skifflong talons: but Penelope,
That never smithhed hand in clinking sl Diablo's tong,
And that neare Calais pourette, sharp Chino,
Whither goes the best man, gave execution free
To his uncle's craft.  E'en then the ship was led
Across the boundless sea, in azure seas, by men
And aliens sovereign.

On they swept, and bore
Pluck'd into their own rectangle, squire afore,
Counsel, parcel, sense, a check instead of check,
And all the graceful seamen; chance and form and fancies,
Husbands, the seamen, with their fragrance and their smile.
Hour after hour before the Achaeans sailed
 Across the hollow horns of the skull, and the mouth
Clove to the prinicipical word that tell'd us there

"from On Seeing Color at St. Vincent's", by Mary Oliver [Living, Health & Illness, The Body, The Mind]
Whatever slumps through the ice

is more rusted than you'd

think, involuting insects

and Christmas cards, letters by the

same name, a datebook entry

original champagne,
old body stocked at

empty troughs, icebergs

dashed blue and hard,

heart swathed in arhabic tales

of knife and teeth, a mint

covered by ice. The mind

spans out through time

into more future, another

nightmare, another stasis,

another kind of escape.

Any argument about

illness during the day

is like: ice crackles

over the pond, a lurch

from physical memory,

the body's built-out

groin, tall trash

mounds in thought, a dome

of bone, one strap

of blue, two voices with

a far off pull.

Nothing can bring

back the tunneling swashbuckling

or the dim moondust

iuries of torch and feather, nights

of pure report wrapped in enough dust

to fill the lungs in ondurs,

the Christmas party where she wore

ivory earrings and a necklace

with a drift of rare

Judea, armload of diamonds,

a magical load on her or her not

ever spoke the creed and it was

a test of strength, that for once

she'd been invited and she'd go.

Everywhere she'd been she was not

there and ice cold logic

could slide over reason. When

she tried to move she'd be tot to

dead, mimesis a lot of that sort

too, but then again the sky

a slip of news in, what with

its not lighted reputation,

the outside world too much adrift

in another regime change,

and the staff on holiday for a day.

"What We Know of the Sixth Manac, Following the Crash", by Denise Knust [Social Commentaries, History & Politics, War & Conflict]
A l'artigue tweeted that the MCB (
The French gesture of inviting the second to step up to the throne whenever a question falls
From his/her keeping while the first man hangs them from crition etc. Took place

After the gesture of his/her not appearing

At convened sessions while the artist is silent. A lot of people wanted to know what the fourth man got to say

When the crash happened. The crash happened. The few

People who were around to see it and the few

People who had been standing there when the thing was gridding and turning were

Proud and unspecified afterward. The qualities of Creativity

Are given a good name to belong to. The wreck

Was given a number. Probably around minus forty-four and a half.

The room was certified carbonindated at that point. Probably.

The room was certified carbonindable. A l'artée

Was certified as having not-feet

Between the seat assigned to it and the feet

Being those white shawls on the floor.

Then the room was certified not certified.

Probably. Probably. We're all one in the end. But who and why

Are still a mystery. Or maybe we are. Or they.

The room was certified CFC (Continuous Four-Fluid)

The crash happened cold at mason jars of water. The room

Was given a cursory dusting with aged paper that may

Have been made like stuff that doesn't wash or

Write for the best, "incendiary" ink, by the people in

The know. Then the remaining stuff was CFC-

DisIZ, whatever the fuck that is. Then "Inc. 5.0" was

Typed into the dial. Whatever that is. Then

The room was made for all that stuff in little

Batches of Time in little Batchles of Dust in a Batchlet.

The dust was given a first dose to the nose & throat. Whatever.

Whatever that is. Then "Inc. 7.0" called

From all those interconnected boxes that hold it and the crash

Was certified one big yawn.

Whatever
======================================== SAMPLE 280 ========================================
The fear of 'plaining, to beg of the party
In whate'er may please the Speaker.

No Chair possess'd by me,
But has inly sigh'd
For the breeze of destruction.
No Speaker possess'd by me,
But hath in warm reprieve
For me, my very life,
 the stream's lazy soft murmuring.

In green yews the day begins,
In livid pyres the night flashes by;
Death groans in the grim fellyau:
The ancient's mystic awe-struck,
Mourns slow, save those faint wistful eyes,
That catch each sigh or each aigl.

All near the churches escaped
Rings the thin, shrill, fitful air,
Where hoarsely, through the gaping gloom,
That old, old nightmare of terror,
Reigns, blind, as of thatch and clay,
Night's sleeping giant.

Such to her was the dreary morrow;
Such shut her out of sight she was made,
Of home, of life, and light, and rest;
That sometimes she dream'd and laugh'd, and dear
Would hers be; but dreams and her laughter closed
As it gurgled from the Gethsemane.

There opened ion a light that cast
Bright eyes about on Larne's bed;
A plaistered pool between two stones
Did on the blackness well rest.
As o'er the hard wind sprung rainbow hues
A golden antique city shone,
So ghastly gleamed the mystic pale
Blazing o'er the yellow fountains
In ghastly quick succession
Flared the fierce brimstone hisses, hissed
Far up in wild igneous din,
And at last the seething water fell
Spouting from under a milky surface
Of sea-marge, or some birch-rod inlaid
Shored by innumerable sprays
Of hoarfug friends in storming to the wall;
And as it roared and splintered, the morrow
Saw the wild Watney's wife.

For now the scarlet sulphureth shine
On this side and that a glistering pale;
It leaves ground what seem'd every thing to show
A dream of naked earth turned silver:
As on each squirrel's fur the blood revolve
In beauty imaged, without humanity;
So the pale phase of a golden rain
On the cottage site, and the bare pebbles bear
The same image of a.

Islands of glittering dust expand her skirt
And her palace-door on either side;
A figure chained to ailing work cannot stand,
But starts and droops an image crooked;
It has for its subplot themist Taylor house,
Which shakes its ancient credo o'er darkey.

Again the veil splits as the April morn
Prompted by urns of gatherèd spring,
And from the dusky ioynal clime of air
A charred lane glows;
It melts, it succeeds, it's the dragon-fly;
It's the lamp that well the iursel and pine:
But sight bespeaks it, the sight to me.

The lichen-stained bricks have not the same size
Subjacent, as the proper parts of my man,
And the pillared villa says Patsa's town;
Azul à la rrió Millar:  it is he!
Azul he ciel! : it is he!  it is Alfredo!
Az about the asperged hat says Patsa, he!
Az: the lily leaves of Millar:  it is he!

Why, then the light must be circular, curving,
And curved on a dime;
Cinctured with miller's beads, with cloudy lustre,
Absinthe-sweet, purgèd on a blue sky;
The glass must run in counter to the action,
It must arc on, as a cyclist

Ah, but why does it hold us captive,
Remote, e'en as heliotrope?
Why does the glass, through which I see these
Hours those who will be-lovely,
Shade and fade, and in the glass turn
Decematched, degradèd, and disembodied,
Inhospitable, and ghostly, and blaspheming,
Make, through the momentary arousings
Of a sun-made religion,
Lair the light of Heaven?

We, for our part,
This weakness should not more ensample claim
Than this infinitude of perusal suit.
But
======================================== SAMPLE 281 ========================================
With so much measure and such reason;
And from the cause why, as princes are
Certain, for their life from their birth,
Why should not Faith be as well
A creature of the same sort and kind?
But leave we these hard objections,
And if Faith be thought a substance,
We may hope for greater bodies
Of thought in the Gods that have the
Absence of certain bodies.

As the body of Faith is substance,
Its shape and its colour,
Its bigness and abuisal,
Its weight and fair and foul adornation,
And it doth dress and pallate
Its customary colours,
Then it may hope for greatness of spirit,
As many substances may hope
For augmentation and for reinforcement,
If only in proportion as they fulfil
The contingent eyes of its fellow-creatures.

As blood may whites and purples differ by
The fact that they are the blood of the soul,
So there be two general sorts
Of vision in the distant traveller.
One is that where all spirits look straight through,
As are the high stars that ground the rate;
And, great amongst great, in its windings folded,
Draws the level of being's increments;
And has the vast mystified chiefest silver
Of numeral colours and shades.

The other is when one oblique
And distant from the sun in eifu,dare
Pointer to thee; or long hoodoo dread,
Where one sees hobgoblins that lie in wait;
And shadows slap and pounce, and snare the soul,
Until their backs are turned to the dead;
When high shadows deep the low and high,
Like forgery with forgery;
Then the dull light is a duller thing
Then the high shadow is a king.

As thick as leaves in winter is the snow,
So fast is thought in Destiny's harlot,
But the process of it in mind is slow,
As thistle-caught were the flow
Of things though still the prey of glee
Till night, or while the smile goes by;
And the self-fed black is the truth in gold
Of the fatuous settling of liars.

He hath slain his dear Rambam, and all his peers
Hath seen his funeral, and his servants slain
Thrones he hath filled at his own cost,
And his heart is numbed at the fate
That he wrought, and his cheeks are dark
At the bliss that has befallen him.
Yea, he shall pass and his name is dead,
And his blood shall be upon his own production,
For he found life and forever shall have death.

A name long recorded and cherished, studied
And 162 years of age, and sent off into air
As our long-haired children pass
From our wise fatherland;
The pen is weary, the stone fired,
Long since down on the hard wood
And the body of Rambam's dispossessed son;

A gentle boy, innocent and quiet,
Sow, like the corn, in the firs of the forest,
He hath seen the sword in the sheath,
And hath known pain without mother or father,
At the word of the Lord the tiger stands
With his sword slanted across the spider,
And the spider, slithering to poison, is dead,
Poisoned with the tinder of the Lord;
And the fire is stew; and the angel of fire
Throws thesmelle to smoke, for his feet are bright
With the smoke of the scorching sea.
And this is Rambam, my fancy to Rambam
Calling from the tree-tops, "Set me down
On yon stone, Rambam, and break of every rod
Upon the trunk, if you will I will obey."

"Is there not," he said, "Madam is in the room?
Why does she come to me but now? what means
Her walking thus long the blood to me?
She would not look once, she would not look before;
She would not have a single word, or a look,
Which should not reach me--Madam will not have it,
And would not think that I had eyes or ears.

"Long ere the breaking of day, I had asleep;
Waked at the dawn, hand-full of fruits and of wine,
And at the palace-top sat in the porch
With the nobles in my party; there I found her
At my saddle, which I uneasily shall ride
Till the heat of setting West in the sun
Casts all the fruit, and from all the branches thrown
I'll hide her straw in the chalice well
======================================== SAMPLE 282 ========================================
Zeus and thy Mother grieved so sore,
That they be-grieved to hear thee cry.

They went out, and under the dark sky
They gathered flowers, to fashion thee
The shroud thou burying take;
Flowers that with heavenly beauty bless
The buried earth-creator's grave.

"On the very-forgotten plain
There where that fiery seraph saw thee die
You suffer'd them you in the sky,
Half of your pain to hide, half of your bliss,
To make one moment all mysteries,
To disguise your secret suffering,
That being well comprehended, it might
Fall unconstrued; yet the best
Plans usually involve a weakness.

"Greecca had chosen well, for all
That grief the family was on her heart,
They should not see its sterner pain increase
At the remembered image of an unkind
And cruel destiny; her being's calm
Might well be tersely written simple 'No.'

"You had gone, indeed, you had gone down
At once to what was wondering still the past,
The strange and unfinished past; to die and live
In all the plenitude of heart's delight,
But this was speaking, and they heard; you have died,
So they told me, or so they said; verily
They only knew, and I, that I died too.

"This is a tale of a look at a picture
Of a family.  My own best way
Was hopeless, and so too was mine that of the two.
To these I applied, and fair there appeared
The way with them; in light, and shade, mixture
Of interests, which to fail would be the less
And the intent of all.  But, like the sea,
Far off they seem'd to run into rocks,
Shaded coldly and distinctly, smooth as true
Paper, even through the sheet, but imperceptible,
Though more diffused, through drift-funneling weather.

This was winter, when the dear friends withdraw
Which availed not.  He had been the brightest star
Of all my youth.  She, fair and low of form,
Had watched him oft, and praised him.  The hour had come
When she withdrew him gently from this smile,
Which seemed to be his idol.  She would not
Enjoy, as Mother though to Lovelace wishes
Herster would have dreaded, that so bright a star
Should fade so any one should see; especially,
Since she was so fair.  His bright fame, and bright
Tam's praises, curved to stars.  She had seen
Her portrait painted, like a reality;
And from a sheet of curious white
Into a delicate veil of stars unfold
Her portrait more natural.  Tam did not mind
The move out of the chic scruples which concealed
His hero, here, in all his agate glory.

But there were other things.  He, the thin, the weak,
Stood in against the idea of his taste,
The idea of perfecting her beauty,
By making too vivid in shrers' eyes
The winter fire of ages.  He would not fear
An age like these, the dull and cold of others,
But still be Tam, and his own taper, and keep
His own fireside a thousand years too.

But he had seen so much, and it weighs on him so
He could not bear its plainness to repeat
His lesson in a polite manner.  A word
Which in those days might prove as fatal as its idea,
Should he repeat it.  There were certain terms of decency,
Which if he forgot them, he might for a time appear
To have forgotten them, and have all Europe on him
As well as on himself been excused; terms
Of etiquette in abridgeable oblivion
Which could not be observed at that time, and then
Would have been extremely well worth perusing.

And then to be a Countess in Italy, and grace
A banquet-listener, would have been
Discovered by a feeling.  Therein to have stood
Upon the least curst of Alpine rock unknown,
Under the same lonely stars which alway
Have shone upon, and never have beheld
More than a single dear familiar face,
Less than a pallid, maternal, maternal hand
To wipe away the tears of, would have been
The lowest point on earth to avenge an insult,
And have alighted at the Judge's door.

But perhaps you would not chime
With too great a notion of the ambition
Of Jules Verne, who could not even reach
An immaterial point for the regulation
Of fluid velocity,

From growing better

Do my part
In that big way which
Tho it means

The past is all gone.
How can I, an old man,
An old man who hasn't killed
A louse, not even a dog,
Not even a fly, not even
A tooth, say I
Shouldn't have stood there, a
menial slave, a plain little
man, and said
That what I had to say
Had more in it
Than seven light bulbs
With little birds to sing
To, what was it, Hawaii?

Why, that's what I
Would have said if, I don't know,
I had a say in things.
I'd say, "O Brix Fawlty,
Brix Fawlty, follow me
Find the king, the greatest king
In the greatest castle, land, sea,
That's enough for a king."
I'd find the greatest king
And set Brix Fawlty on
The greatest castle in the
 Greatest land, sea,, sky,
And everything that's sure to
Never change with each new
day that goes by.

"And I wonder," I said to Brix,
"If --" (I was telling Brix my dream
About the worms) "And if -- you ever
Ever stop to think that a man,
No matter how great, may
Not always be controlled
By every scruple of the truth.

Than is widely rumored
That which is said of Humble

Of the gods."

As thy outward purity thou beareth to me.

Where wast thou, Twelfth Night?
Surely thy slumbers deep were those of a king,
Whenas the firelight flits
Through the shadow of the empty hall;
And in each speaker's countenance bright
There seems to speak a thought of strange import:
Sure thou wert dancing on the squares
Thro' the temporary light and moonlight
Before the altar of the church
In the night of warbled honorms.

Rise up, meet me at the Church;
Rise, and be with me forever;
For pleasure lost and lost undoing,
Dismantle thy dim artificial night,
And mend the dormeate and splothed with moth and dream:
Make love, not prayer thy utmost effort,
And satiate thy mind with best attainings;
Thy heart fromipt with joy, that thou shouldst rejoice,
With a high unction be artful and ceremonious;
Encirit foul with flowers thy chair to clear,
That the woman lie in during times
And her discreetly encout and decoy:
Make use of approved and fishy chirping,
That thy man in his avocations
May not desire too much for her at all:
Let thy quick and most obedient pen
Be inform as God to excuse
In the low tavern of thy sickest days,
When saints and devils meet.

Had I (but I had not) any money,
I had, I have, with more propriety,
Said to her, "Pray, fill up this glass
To the well-behinde glass, God above:
But, ye who are not wise,
Mind, but twice as love her life,
That she ne'er may find it dull with blood.

I who am scantly used,
Have more reason than the grown old,
To hold the true as I the false:
Where the child and the sod did meet,
What shock would come to the head and the heart!
The cup that I would not have her drink,
Makes her tranquil, and knows his duty to cry,
That in listening and weeping fits:
Come round my daughter, child, to the light,
Thou best laughter of false child-virtu.

Is my name Scandal or Beauty or Flirt?
They are many, and many do I own.
I, that having been great stuffed up have shrunk.
I stand childlike, where late high-sounding fame
Knuckled me that I was grown stupid.
Give me, if you have it, the crown of fame:
What'Twad do me, I'd have believed, in good time,
Were not the bowls full, the vial rife with lees.
Then had I whereof I had great delight,
When the tall smiling ambassador
Besiddob was called, and so she was.
Then from the fall of all my spikes,
Resigned to the fire my withering heart.
God Love and I are one: nothing
Can set us old wives braind afresh.

Why dost thou linger'st on the steep?
Clasp, child, to my trembling breast.
Ah, Susanna! ah, Clasp away my breath!
Child-milk they chemise;
And thou, fair saint, clasp for baby's sake:
Thy brother's blood drops in for mine!
Why art thou here, leaning on the steep?
Why dost thou rest on the smooth pellies?
Clasp me hence, sweet sister, closing art.

The boy climbs up on youfos, on whales' skins,
The furrow till comes the furrow's end:
And here's the flour, there's the pasture at last.
The furrow still goes, but not the way it went:
The boy climber of the steep comes down
To child-heart undrest, and there's child's-sleep.
And he is forgot; but thy brother God
Calls back with fresh youth to help and mother.
So help me, you, most high, ever purpose bright,
Sure hope, and faith, and conscience clear.

God! how my heart is weary of such wore homes,
Such tired souls in love no more: To the wild desert Go, with the red trees only
Pathum-ed, and the winds only lightly thrown
Dark leafless…O sopt red heart's dread savor, God
Bade thee breed the baby of my people here.

Still kept complete on the dust they lay:

What's that dark star to the white moon?
Not night itself, that is a star
For night, pure and precious as all those
Whose birth-nights keep their queen within
Luminous orbs of heaven; and so
All night shall keep her hearts in love,
Sealing their dear joys till death,
Be it what comes, be she what dies.

Heaven, thousand-sown,
Where thy daughter sits
Brows overhead,
And opens all thy days
With one soft change.

Be hers the rose's perfume
And the low-lying waters' sound,
And thy sweet-hearing pans
Disturb the night;
And the nightingales' wish, and the rose-thrill
She takes of her great love, her own
Love-whispered sound and smell
She makes for thee; be she as fair
As the night her princess' gown gave thee
When at table there thy morn was cold.

Is this the sign?--then I shall fly
Home to thee, to my love, to see thee.
Thy father's garden, fill'd with rain
And radiance, where I won't see
More eyes of men, but of thy love-hours.
No longer let yourselves go fast
In red and gold for ever, tits and tramps.
There comes a time, a fart in the sun, for thee,
That's the time to woman or to glory.

Not the flowers, for they grew too fast,
Nor the years, for they were too kind:
They alone of course are great,
Who make many men as gay
With rose-leaves and their own smiles;
And yet those other deal with thee
In pleasant ways, that thou should'st deal
With them for many years;
Succeed your grandfathers, thy father,
And thy mother's mother before her:
Thou journey's end is when they stop.

There is a love-world more like the heaven
Of expression than the love-world of deed,
With which we might seem to go and visit
The Puritans, and turn the trope up high,
And upaw them with ill poetick chur"r,
In spite of rhyme and reason.

We of somber speech arrive in may,
As weary as frames of glass at noon,
And look, as secret folk, and make conjecture
How sweet may be that sinlese of your speech,
Which speaks in you of holly and ivy
To the just bloom of man and his poetry.

May there be flasht of flame in burnt where
Hid in the bud the red of wine.
And there be need of blood where the aim is
To blurt pure passion out, and leave
The modicum of weak resentments
O'er the gun with a sigh at last.

May the bird yet find no moment's scope
Within the circle of your reach
To flutter of shafts, to shaft and try,
To live in vain for sorrow, faint,
To wane and fade ere that they die;
In which the red is of a suicide,
And the white is the soul.

I am not great, I own, in words
For many stroaves with the spray of fame
Have burst mine earthly doors--but I shall
Receive and let me dwell in you
The deep sustaining light and refuge be.
And if you hold to your old philosophy,
And feel that the fame of him who sings
Out of life, lives in us--then the pen
Lost read with a faith in God is in God.
Then we are kindred; and I best deserve
To stand in the doorway of your gallery,
And your great there-theatres "with you" 11 years
Where you are strongest, and where you need.
Then you shall know my atil and success.
Had you known me Dante could never left Tasso.

Now there's a ship coming out o'er the sea
From France, as I know just well,
That's come up with a great flat goody,
From where it went into Norway
And back.
And she's bringing passengers.

Oh look at the skirts of those women,
They are coming on.
Prithee, chile, chile, chile.
So it is you
That comes of the angels, I guess.
And all me

And many times, when times were bad,

But leave your hard commands to these, your brass
For goose-feathers, up to Colchos! we
Shall to our iron yield allegiance.

The strength of this modern Rome is not that which prevailed in it
Beneath the trappings of the Caesars;
The shame that is not felt in obliterating the hairs
Upon the crowns of the effigies;
And the enormity of this modern Rome
Is not pinioned by and by.

The very truth--that is, the truth concerning Sparta,
Is accounted as the bugaboo
And eclipsing glass of Laches.
And you must be Sparta in a reverie
When you're Sparta under the needle and the light
Of your Ti claim from the half-totten sands.
You'll sit me down and state the case in simplicity,
Whistled off like a gargantuan peacock,
Thick-bunioned in ermine, with its head turned as high
Up as your eyes and when you have handled it
Move the head round of its departure
And look at your fingers and then at the toes
Of your Bernini.

This modern Italy is fed
By the Hunger, so gratified in giving our lives
Up on credit to the starving, that her coffers run nearly dry
For the taking by the Americans and the Turks
And the Russians, while she is lending them broth in droves
To our lunatic and idiotic kings.

For a beginning in points, nor yet paid up in totality,
Are our feelings for our arbitrary King,
Who, at a supper of Moorish cattle for his troops,
Is struck blind from within his heated!
Mot just brew!
And we have gone with his Broad-fronted Raiders
And watched our own rum fed Champions bleed
In a hopeless, unbroken, disastrous retreat
That has done both teams public hurt,
And left them, among us, understandably mained
For the rest and passing of that day,
With no more than the pride of their good success,
And a host of pondering men enough minded so
That they might revel, o'er olives, with an unoffending grin,
While we, the benumbed and afflicted, fought on the onset,
And watched them and wished the day was about to end;
While we, who were not only traded in, but fought for
Milch cows, ourselves a cow, ourselves a nation of wickets,
Might get sad when they told us that we were losing,
And wish that we had left plenty of scraps for the rabble,
And hated it that we had won and not that one had.

I see it all the same, they are both of them dead,
They both of them dead, and the fortress is a tomb;
Italy is free, Italy is free, and the man is dead
Who was if I had the happiness to see it,
And the world is far nearer the best of any
Any I know, with or without him, and I am fit
To take my fortune as I can get it--and the rest--
Sailing myself, as far as I know.  Tell me where and
To whom I might do my very best, and be
Sleeping that.  Then I take my feet to the candle,
And see if I still get off the plough when the night
Palsy the pan!  If so, I have something to dream.
As I have slept, I know the Night, and the stars,
The Stars who rule the plough, and the trade
(If a thing may be made known), and the rapids and the heights
Of the river, and the fowls who flee from harm,
And the jay's tang and the crow who clings years on,
And the wonder-bird, and the what-not of the something-of-a-Nature
Who plays with kittens, and happily alone,
If not, and in any case cannot come

 claims nor heirs, but sleeps
In the low country of dreams,
And lies there still, the gray-beard,
And dreams, all his might is spent,
And all his days wasted
And all his glories fled;
For now, alas! his eyes
Are open to the blind,
And his great name is lost.
And, oh! for that earlier time
When, before us, had seemed so clear
A visible star-glistening sign
That we should go our ways,
And remain with those we loved
And loved alike.
But now, indeed, we know
That life is less sublime
Then that pale gleam of hope
At best, and queen-like on the throne
And princely sceptre of
Queen-now, warn'd, dismayed
We, the lost ones, lie
Unwept, untied, unheeded lay

Black the night-shade, bitter the air;
Hem the hair of the damp,
Under the frost and the snow
Grow the hair-goggles,
Bitter the fog-grips,
Tough as a winter's hide;
Hair so wry the scalp so vast
Pricks up in it, and goes
Strained from the boughs, flitting, the eyes
Melted, and all sprung to the brain,
Glow in the fog, the nose smeared
With the stink of the rainy morass, the nose jerting
At the unpleasant breath that shifts
Bulbous in the trees, the eyes, rolling, blinded;
All jangled and jerking and sliding,
Tangled, effusive of feeling,
Limping, lascivious, and passionate,
The broken, diffident, and scanty
Ambition, the skin all over
With the burn, the tosick, the smothering sweat,

All that wracks it, all that it omits,
And all that it possesses.
Naughty, faint, and sickening the cheeks,
Nigh the sodgy leper is fit to give up,
Cheerless the stir for the sloppy grotto,
Dreary the huddling corners, to the rain
Brushing the loosening cinder-stalks, and all
Lithe and miserable the upland,
Dreommlike the fetid, the dusty, abating grotto,
And the dreary open space, the borealiscing pasture;
All the sweltering, dusty face of the Lugana,
All the sombre colours, the shabby, shivering tones
Spitting forth from it in thin streams, and all the
Repast of the dusty palate, and the lips
Tight, and the breathing
Wild with the chill, with the starving um-percentage of breath,

"Then a touch of water helps us, a touch
Rain-coolant, a splash of Lempo's lake, a sinfzen
Cerise, a nigger on your knee, and a bit of you
Mysterious, sweet, and sensitive potion of
Mystic juices, and a stroke of your fine Parian lair
Dull as onion, and as tranquil, and strontian
As the half-recluse who trod the sweet earth
Of Pirenian Lugdun, or the farm-boy and dead
No more."

"That is she, child," the man said, "with those grey eyes;
She wears the specific.  Grey as a morn in
The days just gone, greyer and greyer, and as she
Looks not now, she will not look; and that booty she
Lets her pirated hand fall with that grunting that
We say is moral."
"Who picks pocket here?"
"A boyish trifler, who has tawdry notions
About the fashion of the world."

"But 'mick you say, is not he a saint,
A certain stature, chipper manner, a mouth
That might supply soup-kitchen colours
To the undistinguished calf in the kennel,
Or Stella's twanging boy the unicorn
Would make to gaudy red and black in all
The russet khaki of the stall?
Perish the wish!  Who finds fault with
Your youthful 'fence, runs the risk of living
Ready in the whorish air, in the wide
Grass, in the moist time-freshened grass, in
Blessed Statorius's river, in the gleaming
Marshland of the manse, in barbaric
Skin of the swart creeper who lives by the bay,
And wades deep for a crab-like instinct."

I knew that these things are eternal
because of your words.

I said:

O, God, thou art so good.
The very Eternal made thee
To be loved.
All this thy works so full of gladness
Because thou'rt dear to me.
Thou turnest hand thou takest for thy sake
From many men who've little hands,
And kindleth with strong light
All things made with hands,
Made all with love.
All things thou takest,
Thou'rt keep even though men say they've seen
Thy power fade,
Thy presence doth abide
Still in its throne
Alone amid the universes 17.
Thou'rt so far more than omnipotence
I cannot stay anywhere
And slay each creature there
In turn.
Thou art the strength of Olympus
Among the clouds.
And this, and this,
I do remember.

Was lowered. I knew

Of my fate. He had done true work

Yet it grieved me in a sudden

Of my fate.

, chas'd with crimson salt,--
The strong doctor (whom I must excuse
For stealing from his village, free to buy,
But not from the post serv'd the hero of the cause).
He also showed us, as we'll not soon forget,
The last costly loaf he ever ate
(Of which the disappearance of so foul a brand
Was marr'd by fire, to show the most incompetent
Fiscal officers what they've got to spend)
His large and architectered brain,
A lucky fall in selling his stock at a perwt,
Which (in consequence of this short appearance
Of his prodigious legacy, which he'd left behind)
I promis'd, might run to massive rent;
And dangle from a bough, at the first ripe rust,
We affooved ourselves with this most lickable rate.

Thus, from the ruin of great estates, to buy
A little patch of earth, in this small bin room;
And not knowing how 'tis that man amasses so
Much wealth, if any sorts it seemeth most his own,
I haz'd it up now--not without some such guidesthe rich to plunder.
We were not long upon our transaction then
Abide.

The Queen and Prince knelt down, and confounded prayer,
When both were pouredbing from their cheeks the sweat
Which thaws the stored light of the sun at night,
Till the brown water of the weighing gel succeeded
With what beween us both to the southern sea,
And how the same, after that short period,
Our younger gallop'd on over land
To fet it by the mere expanse of the world
It was all very beautiful, and yet troublesome
Our friend was of his young blood young,
And his life was still the kind of a dream,
And it's a good one to keep a son's mind abreed
With the prospect ahead,
So he'll have a faith in doing the deeds of remembrance.
The wind still lay along
With a sound of leaves blown softest by
The gliding flesh of the spirits, and blown swiftest by,
And the shimmering, shifting flesh of the matter
Made all alive as off a pace
This way, and that, and another way, the flesh
Of our most familiar things,
With most ordinary things, and trivial things,
As trim and mild as tranced mornings
And violent as southern gusts,
They went before
Our King, and revelling in the state,
To meet whither they were told:
And henceforth after the traceless air
They kept, until they knew
The jest, and saw how work
Could keep them cognizant of the years.

To stoop and stitch once more the Compassion Deity
(Which is, of course, the same as your old friend
The God in Heaven, the man in the prints).
His Compassion Philips gave up, and bought
The right to hurt our well-being for good,
And snap the top of the fourth estate's head
When they slip-sluiced in the herb of thyme.
They were not so blest in having Licensinge
To dose them with any puddingish pitch
Of pain, when time has two ounces 22 grains.
I grieve to relate, since his going,
A mortal tooth has set the pin
For biting, as the meal hours may keep
The office of a banana.

But oh, to be wonderful, drenched in gold,
Like gold ruffles the track of an amoeba,
To tread your life out all things come true
That's your debt left upon amassing;
To be strangled with flowers, whose death is the blue
Of a new penny; and, peering too,
To be a thorn of enormous sharpness.

I have no nation now where that land
To dig my grave--nor any father now,
Save--save him whom all the world is made to hate--
Save him who makes the wombs of death
For us--who are the flood of all men's slaughters,
The sea of all things sterile. Save my son's soul,
Threatening and agony-begot, who takes
The woman's bleeding in his angel hands
And bores her to the heart of God's hand
To pray for him, and lifts her up and feeds
The desires which burst her through his mercy's plannage.

'Gainst all things good and great which my soul
Out of the depths of this dark earth can see,
I would walk forth again in light and air,
Strong and untamed, no more a prey to terror;
A God-loathing priest, like all the rest,
Take thou my place, 'gainst the battles of the crowd,
And ever with man's religious crafty men
Oppose, and work their purpos'd destruction round,
By me 't will help thee--and on the side
Whereon thou surf'st, thou tread'st o'er troubled waters.

O'er woody woods, O fond Palliduck,
Sound forth without a soundfulness of thine!
Sound forth the plea of all things wild and fair,
Which thou encounter'st on each bright dawn!
O'er the green grounds and golden glimmerings,
O flute on the steps of the wind, sound out,
Sound forth, there is no good thing in the wide world more joyous

Than when again with chapman throts of wordless love,
With all the fervor of our human wish,
We make known to each other the dreams and wishes
That labour over the still, wild path of years;
And with the worm joyously in tune,
Story over story, and wish, issue, issue,
Happiness,--till perplexed-shy life unrolls,
And with a sudden shock, rocks at once,
Struggles, and laughs, and lets himself out,
Expell'd by Halleluiah from life's work.

Lo, how all things tremble and reflere,
Wailing or syren, over bruised and weak
Wings struggling down the sudden shock of years
Round her and under; lo, how hush the still waters,
Silent the swift breezes, how the thin clouds quiver,
Bending with pity some black hill's steep top,--
Or under the mill-house roof's rent.

Pallid and solitary as at first,
Wailing or weeping, now silent and bold,
He turns to her, on the high hillside;
The rain comes down in her wrath from the cloud;
Unflowing, it soothes her,--comes in an apology,
After the tempest call'd on God.

Dares she dream? dares she dream,
Of what?
After so many yearnings, so many
Sad kindling kisses, how her sleep is yet young?
Can it be
 That she waked,
And went up to the moon,
To see if it lighted,
And if she mind,
And what her ancient dream meant,
Before she off and forth,

Before the she enters in at night,
Before the gate so old and deep,
Is opened, and she sees, and
Finds she so much,
Such an one?
And before the gate whereto
Is she viewed,
And afterwards, every one
Is opened, every one
To the abode
Where I am?

From whence I am,
There peep they,
And so
Wherever they will,
Good sooth me!  Happy
I shall be!  I am content.
Can it be
That they enter in?
And then how they grin!
But to-night
They shy,
And now they stand,
My joy-seekers all!
Ah! kindly they stare
To receive me with
For their night's pleasure,
Though the wondering moon
Breathes too much!

And so the others stand and stare
To see the strangers from the wood,
The darlings of the wood,
Bidden by the awful fay,
With a plague is come
For my sake to be,
And see they do not fret,
And do not struggle
To be admitted through the gate!

For when I am at my wish,
There's no one to say, "This is vain!"

With no one to praise, I love to meet
The kind, good people of the town;
And I can laugh with them, and say,
"I have done my work and can show
The fruit of all my toil and care!"

My God, I thank Thee that Thou hast given me
Honour and happiness;
For, is my way with those who criticise
Truth, honour worse than Heaven?
And I more than rejoice
To serve Thy true eternal Majesty
If so I may embrace Thy love.

To serve Thee, O Lord, with heart and will,
So far beyond my days;
It lifts my wandering feet to Thy red Rug,
And so I go with hearts true.
Lord, for I must give Thee an opening sign,
A sick heart to give it!
The only sign
That counts, the only song that counts,
My every misty sign.
Ah! Lord, I lay my sign before Thee,
My heart and hand, my sign!
It is not wisdom, love, nor fame,
Nor worldly splendour fadeless,
Breast, and hand, and eye, and brow,
Will come, or join, or survive,
The redeeming cross of Thy Son.
But give, Lord, give to me this good,
The one great cross of Thee!

'Let trust (if trust may be)

She stepped toUnchaliews early, and said,
'The first light of the sun is dead.

'Or last, or first, or eye, or ear;
Or the third or fourth. Or the hand.'
She laughed to hear me talk that way,
For Emily had two eyes and three ears,
And more soft hands than any so strange.

'I made the claim, if we were wed,
I should have four feet.'
'Four feet!' said Emily; 'three--three!'
'I have no teeth, so, please you know,

'Where I was, there was not a house,
Where I were not mightily.'

'Where I was, Death struck the will.
We have yet made selection.'
'Our will! The wild might set us free,
And we have touched the tether.'

'If the mightier boast the right,
Then we a mightier thing. Where I was
There were not one such as we are.'
'A mightier thing? It cuts the wind.'
'Our words cut the wind, and our eyes.'

'Our eyes! But I could not speak to them.'
'Our eyes!' she said; 'the one good eye
The joy of the second morn.'
'I could not speak; I was not born.'
'I was not born to look on either.'

'What, if the mightier thing be me,
And I turned by the web to it,

-"So?" said she, with envious smile,
And levelled at her one thin cheek
With one high finger of her hand.

Then, feeling ill at ease within,
She tried to steal away
With one long look
Of sidel Satis-bon,
But reeled in vain!
The gate clattered hard behind her,
The yard was full of hounds,
And she was found again,
With pained and hurried grace,
In the small little house,
A little tin-held Jinn
Tabarded in blue and white,
Who cold and dreadful said--
"We've seen this kind before,
Tell us where your God is, where your wife is,
And what has love of you given you, good my lord?
What has love of you given you? you that busy, busy fool?"
She could not finish her tale
Because she thought no such beast was still alive,
She said she hoped she were.
She said she hoped she were still living,
As lords do, who worship things that live under heaven.

And then he beckoned his pack.
"Hound of ninety fleas!
Come, fall at my sire's heels,
Come tear him raving blind!
If I am dead, at the very least
Let my sons, my daughters, round him blow,
And my long-lost, late-returning sons, at my encounter.
Come!--the God of war has laughed upon the easements,
The temples are beaten from the earth.
The castle-stone of all my hopes is broken,
My hubge's-horn is crowning my brow.
On!--who is laughing now?
On, who is leaping for joy?"
And he said:--"Wherefore dance ye if ye're wise?
Your sire was an outcast, an outcast's a secret,
Full well known; 'tis his free will the world has stolen away."
She did not answer.
He said:--"Why have ye not heard my word?
Why come ye here now? when I spoke to you once, ye declined,
Said ye, 'I'm not his wife enough!' yet were ye not for quick feet come?"

To sit upon the difficult triangle,
And tread on the uncertain pinions.

Brave clown Tommy, riding well;
Onward we ride in fast college?
He sweeps through the bright-blue European night:

Round the raw horses, out-pawed, or he?
At first he fancied it some dream he'd dreamed
Which had come true. Then, when he found it a novel
Setting him to piece, he shook his head, and sighed.
It was, he cried, his best published piece. And so,
Putting aside some fifty years, the hour was right
To bring it to proof.

There was a Quaker, a man much older
Than I, who dreamed much more than I, much more.
His life had taken wing, with hope shattered,
And fallen around, in one desultor,
Collapsing, like Atlantis when Gondel set
His mighty coils in seaward. And he held,
Our lives no longer, but years, the thought:
"Some great error I have made, a great error,
That never in the memory of man
Shall be rectified: a wrong that I have done,
And be much too heavy a weight to bear,
Far from my native land, far from my native air,
And with the names of people not around me breathing, I
And my loved compatriot, wrong that never shall be righted,
Here in an alien country, in an alien earth."

When I was young, I cannot more determine
Than how once I dressed, how far, how near,
How deeply, how strangely like a certain thing,
With shakes, with sorrow my feet then were bruised,
And all my heart was disturbed that 'th pressed
For me those things I had remembered; and then
I would wade in tears, or now would tread
O'erflowing stripes, and now a man might see
How wise is tenderness, how weeping might make
His heart quick, and my torn-up bow sit.

But where all things have made an end of sorrow,
All things have a meaning; where all things have an end,
And I ponder, wise, young, all things have been done
For aught else but for my sake, I would go cry;
And would sit me down to faintness, lean'd, disquieted,
Like a little child to weep are not as yet made for an end,
But for my sake, go cry, for my sakes sake go cry, and go!

All day I have wept, and even with my tears
I hear the gulls upon the batteredgrooves,
Pass over halls where bloodne's effusion forms,
Blood, tears for effort to remember a life lost,
My heart goes out to thee, when I am foun'd,
Doun the roofs I grow not weary, I do tell myself,
In sooth, what another thought than to be me!

Daughters, what I have said may have been none,
May not be weighed with ages eternal,
On a bed of roses spread, with greens in vair
Of violet, for I have you male bards renown'd
Who walk promiscuous in lowly mood.
Still may they mercia not be confin'd,
But like the glorious earth may grin in joy,
Nor do lay, nor leak, nor any lull, not one,
Not long to hasten nor yet to hurry forth,
At their mother's knee. O hearsed in vain
Of winds, and not of you, whose works are astound,
Whereto you hang, and through whose limp life drops
Blood at your feet.

And yet--for blood looks vales on the hills
And beauty spreads its dominion
Of arteries to anart of beauty
On lowly features, lip and brow--
And not in raiment of the dead
Dawns some bright life--but in your kindles blood,
As life in the breath that drawing them
Hastes. Stand! be a brother to the beautiful!
For though the dead live still, the dead have sleep'd,
And voice may hear them hear, and serene,
Tongued, monstrous mouth.--And so my thought went forth,
As forward stages threefold, from the lake's cavern
To the loose stones by the shore, with pipe,
And touched by that hope which goes beyond hope.

The boyish years have burnt their central flame
On the young heart; and now toward her heart
The fish Aurora the green trout draws
The crowding stream.--Let us but do all and all--
And your hope is to be laughed at!--Nay, nay,
I was not call'd to breathless drifting thither,
But to breathe more Hockey-in of the lake,
And give the puck to Hockey, when he's served out
This thing or that in.--And so I were content,
Were it set to

We have flown the eagle of your lightning and the nightingale.

No dream is this of weak fools, catching hate's bugs,
No dream is this that holds all the swag of knowing,
No dream is this mockery, and no dream is this
Where dreams are all base, where men dream what men dare not believe.

In vain your memories weigh us down with memories,
In vain man sighs o'er sums backward falling for truth,
In vain man fears what himself divined not, and becoming
Wise passes to his neighbour a word that himself has dared.

In this desert land where feet before
Never began to trace the borderless dark,
Nor eyes became fully his or hers,
Never bloomed vision where no fall ever occured,
Never bloomed love where love was venom and hidden,
Only our differences becoming was seen to be
In the long division, each the other's front in fear.

Yet never turning from this desert land
Never ceasing, forward ever taking aim
At this empty, grimy place, we, who grew up
In it, turning back toward the border now,
Remembering that this land is but a long death wish'd for,
Slaves aiming at their masters, shuddering at the dim

Spirit flying with guns, the speeches
And parley of swift feet over sandstorm made,
Pity shifting us from one society to others,
Spending each day as a carristano loves to take,
Seeking on each action, behind each military move,
A sense of each man's place in God's balance, a slow eye's drying

Or new horror in the mind's picturing of war,
The fall of an eagle into the pit of its nest.
In vain man stirs, ever making distraction
From this myrtle chamber and the calm of each tree
Where splayed leaves fill new hunger for the next one.
Sudden fright, shock of colours, tortures swift,
And swift return to life fear breeds hate not ydpring
Not any demon abortion haunts my battlefield
Not hate's old spectre but the old hero's old ghost
Not man's brutal reason but natural fear, old life
Not love that charms us, but the old thing's new love
In danger's present rough love to be naturalized
Not beauty's square feet on height any square feet match
Not nature that bade trust nor trust artificial
Not impeding time nor time keeping angel
Not bodily pain's war, but collective pain
Not future past nor happy earthbound horizons

"Life, 16: Refusing to Go to War", by George Meredith [Living Oh, the civil wars of young men!—]
'Tis agreed, so gratis, there's no denying it now, I did not join in spite: I joined in love, Could nothing else but freedom to indulge. Why am I thus seen to sweat, Though all my money I'd see Freedom's fight o'er banker's manuro; Give blood, to show the link 'twixt eye and eye, Make patriot's throat a duty'—is like Diestrial day, I wash my comrades' boots, Though in army 'tis blasphemous to linlour.

Based upon the facts known to us.
Who that is pious a month, or year,
A month, or two, will confess to be,
There's nothing at all then to cause him to wince.

Wherefore my "Sister, the weary waiting's over,
The bell's toll'd, we come, you may go forth to-day."
She "That's just it, my beloved; for you,"
And since I've had my share of consolation
In such sweet strictest charity, no more
I stand confest: but if you the hour end
A second visit, to the inn I'll go,
I would go there, some way, just to look;
But if the lady is there, I forget;
Who was, that told me to come here?"

"Oh! not to-day: you must be known to me:
But I'll allow, a month past in the street,
You to have known me--I mean a little fellow
Who came some cues to fight, and beat the dog:
The doctor bore his clobber, and my tosser;
The doctor, and his young twins (below) was bavin',
In this shirt that makes a man very clean."

"To-morrow Eve he or I will dine with me,
We may meet then, perhaps, in the glades of Pan;
A shawl shall wrap him round, and I his water."
I was loath to break the surprise, and strove
To work it in as I would a decent beef:
"A shawl,--'tis final! you, your scarf, and me, your,**
The ladies of the house will know it all;
Your hand's a dainty rib-bon from me it shall be,
Though I come without a scar. And you, too, forget

All these shall know, by the signs I have show'd,
That I do love fashion, style, and rules:
I have the arts to stir the fire and boil the water,
And ways and means to save the same;
I have the art, inside and out,
To make a coat that will stand the wind and rain,
A handsome looking couple:
--But on this favour notice is given,
And these conditions shall be kept,--
That Robert be no more the Grocer's constant friend,
And get no orders from him:

No more at noon he shall come to me,
To get a pot of ale, that's handy dry:
Yet if you'll order it I'd get him there,
As well as John; but, be sure there's beer
He'll pour it into cup as soon as we come:
But this I say, I'll only order beef,
That's not here, I mean on the continent:
That's taught a say, that last day's beer was hoi mod."

"You will see me at the fair,
Mysel'. If you should speak to me, then
VERSE will turn and speak me very shade of 'No.'
To VERDI as he bares municipal graffiti,
Whose title is 'Postmaster General, Save the King.'
He'll look at that, and then on matters wise
Th' important word is cabinet. Say to the groom,
You shall survey no change, which he might think
Is strange: now the postman's chorus
Ripes up his print to 'duplicates.'
I do not forget that an early thing is nearer
 Than it was last. But tell to MRS P,
That now there's but one left, who's used to keep
All sorts of parades in suspense, like decor,
As soon as he gets off the horse, or flower,
The which he's old and hasn't now, by halves."

"When the embers of last night
Burn out, 'tis a little thing,
But a sorely throwing off causes me
Most dreadful blasts, when I sit night with."
But though very cold 'tis not a chair
Is to be squeezed in cracks, or snuggled in,
Without a space for a smoke, or the show
Of peeping or pressing eyes.
It's rude to awake a sleeping companion,
Or cry aloud, rouse him.
If the journey be long,
Let your stops be very far apart,
And the whiskey first shot out;
With a full peck, or with a jam
Fill the glass twice fill,
And then have your way:
If your parliament or board have business
Meant well, begin it now,
And if they Blessing's prayer have had,
Don't for the world mistell
That prayers full free from canker flow,
As we trudge

but wait to hear what you'll say when we've gotten
you both to rest, and then I'll let you know.

"That's what I call 'taking it slow,'
because I don't want you to be upset

without laying the groundwork first
to make you and the baby ready for its arrival.

We'll call the baby Desdemona,

after Charlotte Brontë's beautiful short story 'Desdemona notvarum,'
but you can call her Spanish, imitative of the Catholic imitative form

of the saints' births. Imitative indeed, for the Latin words for 'desire' and 'despair' in the Greek

Her message was faint but plain,
And plain as is a candle-light
At which fishes go by;
Her golden hair flowed out in jets,
Like silver streams through flowers,
Her mother-hood's rawhide coat
Clothed her fine as polka-dots,
And, like hornets, her eyes
G clustered full of honeyed tenderness.

(26)
She, the only one, with whom
The night can charm our home.
When we would peep,
She would stay holy till the flood
Of the moon-washed crook-grass,
Or the flame-o's red inn.
The lilies of the valley
Around her feet they'll close,
The red roots clinging.
She comes, she comes, and then
They close, all go,
They say, "We shall rise no more
Till to Charlemagne we come."

Is more than all the heroes of old Rome
Who in the center of their cities stood.

Let us not then be late to our home.
To-day we go away from it
To show how pomp is fettered,
The masses in its pastime
Be the same who sought in vain
For the true champions of the cause
That was to-day's chariot-racing royal chariot-racing
The champions sought not as they neared old age
In the shadow of immortal Mystery.

But of the champions of to-morrow
None need we be afraid,
No doubt of us shall be.
When the man of iron has been whirled from the whirlpool to the wave,

But of the men who in old days could swim in the breath of the disaster

What meteors were they that came forth from the shock

Of that black wave?
They shall be dust,--and yet what seeds
Of glory are there in that seed
Stored in their willpower? What eyes can they see
In the shells of that one white to-morrow
Canought with the trivial when seen by the dead?

What armies can have armies in them
What armies of dead men who died too late
To have any memory of their rage
Or their hate, shall have. The seed of time
Is in some men a menace and a curse,

And to some of its natures restraining interdolon.

'Tis well for us if we de-hair ourselves,
'Tis well for us if we wear the superstition of tears,
Wearing of bellies savage, crude-barked with the vision
Of the jaws of fate, the cup of endurance grim.

For we are told that the Houri Queen City
What is a Goddess of Infamy now draws its mask
From the lean cheek of a man by the white beard allowed,
In a pit to live or a niche in the dred of the public toil.

Ay, all that is black is black indeed!
What eyes can we have that see not in the black stream
The stroke that shall surely come? What hands know what depths
Of the blue American sea will the red red flood first flush?
Harpails of South sea lady-catalogues,
Anotes of Orpheus, letters of Horace
Are nought to us, they are red-shods all.

What shall be, be it black, nor is it well
To fear it, but as there is a swing
In the swing, the further the cable is borne,
So the surprise is better than the sleep.
What is by the swing? What is by the cable?
There is no chance of a greater chance than meets the son.

So the Lord of all diversies
To us the third of all forms,
And the finder of them all.
And they who claim to have heard,
In themse' and in themselves,
Hear still, though not to our liking,
The voice of the strangester
In the field of linguistics.

A phrase from Donny Milton's song
Makes all the the foregoing no matter plain:
"At this time of night,
"My dickens' adventure's breech," etc.

The first time I came in gear was
On a' nices, and, hands down,
'Twas so! and all conjugal;
The next with the crockets loaded
Was on yon kickin' leg,
And third, as yet past caution,
Aclose, we all felt we'd crashed
Upon the straitest precipitance
In e'er bit of our lives.

So run child's plays, as caranimate,
On the odd loaded lint-winds,
Till yer omnibuses they come down
To moppery, yer dirig.
And when like alack! the road ye breeze,
That was the settle vote
That hid the roundelay.

First, from the bay where wave amiller lies,
The rest falls right, god save the king,
From flood to flood we go down
Into the cheerful crawl of stones
To sodom, garden, loftiest shack.
We strip the waterways bare
For ye shall slice a sausage and sip
Your piker, dine upon porter,
In the rainy Sierra.

And so I drink your strivings and broths
Of the thatchiest patch of stile
In all the heath-famed Delta,
That Cain do the red-nosed set
Observe; and as thatht blooms bear
In the dust of their hives on east
To freshen west, so, dove, man,

In a temperate climate
When, in the progress of years,
The civil liberty of man is known,
How deep, deep, deep, must the shade that grows
Beneath the sun-beholden tree!
It is not a dream; I stand in light,
And all the energy of soul, and face,
My soul and face were formed to speak this word:--
That I am thy child,--thy child,--thy child!
I am thine,--thy heart's prayer,--thy child,
My little king,
I am thine,--the sceptre of the fields,
The righteousness of life,--thy child.
My son,--the first-born of thy line,--
Healer of thy diseased soul,
The spotless sceptre of peace;
Thine, thou father of a charge
Matured through youth;--the crown-jewel gold
Of heaven's elect, the gem of man.
I am thine,--thine, father nature!
Nature,--the child of the god,
The glorious god, the living man.
The god, and man, and manly man,
By nature, as by art, are grown;
Match yet, the defiant angel!
Match us, as we match our fell,
Unrighteous, breath'd species, who usurp
The throne of Nature's mundungann
Darkon'd in the abyss of hell!
Match us, good friend, the last in place,
The best man, of place and power, no more
Qualities to blend in one harmonious style,
Make ready, all ye powers within
The incubating such, and foul
Fruit of all good to shut apart,--
Match us, ye who make the earth a stone,
Ye Bong-like Chols, Brough-like Luthers,--
Match us, match us; and then
Lord, allow the Birth of the Law,
Thy holy ear--turn to the rock,
Match us, yonder British Sepoy!

Who made the lords of re-living,
Lord-many a blundering banker,
A splendid family to sing to,
To blame, like Socrates, and be read,
For what their fortune, or their fame,
His path would not by chance be unaccounted.
And hence, in such a work, he thought,
To win at double or nothing.
One fault (his special vocation)
To bad by superfine gossips, the Folk e'en
Would count him false, would count him
Beneath his honest credit.
Of the pope no more unfair men
Than are the Spaniards of Isabella,

And e'en the pope, a man so bad,
Could not believe a word the Turk said,
Ere from the city by a route
Advert he e'en to death, to his death.
And the plain truth is, as he would be,
Was fain to death himself to death inclin'd.
A motive is that nothing we
Largest, motiveless; it doth exist
Nothing weALTH cannot make us, can e'en death.
It is more, it is a life of fate,
A life of heroic life, a destiny
The gravest, darkest, mightiest, destiny
Of all extant in speaking or written nature.
Match him tho' with his saints, and these with him search,
Match him by biography and biography,
Charity by right, and grammar and prose
By mode, and you'll find that thus he hath been
All human names but with himself incorporated,
And in him there's nothing, nothing that's mortal
Can hope or master-word, that hath not one
Or few only fit so, to be incorporated

And break the line of ARQuORDE, as he did by

A shining arch of blue
Of night of summer skies!

And dew will soon be coming
For flowers to wreathe themselves;
We'll laugh at harpers' tales,
And crane our necks to see

And to theest of blossoms goest,
Where the birds, penned in their bowldens, sung,
A rare, hidden little birds
Their purple lungs pour.

And all day long, from waking dream,
A candle shineth
To welcome him; for what could be
More glorious on the earth?
O little lord of all the globe
Up not yet to the royal seat,
Yet waiting all the time,
How shall he grapple with the world

When thou art there, thou only there,
What shall avail the thunders?
What the storms that thunder throw
With round white lightnings about thy place?
What the tempest for the throne
May hope to make it endure?
What the gulfs foreseeing
May the future yield,
And the floods its shores extend?

What if it not seek the waste
And two days long Ammon?
What if it other await
The windows of the east,
The pillars of the westy night,
When darkness doth keep
Sleeping only for the night,
When the moon, slowly, turning,
Saw through his turned-back windows
The stars that awaited,
The moon that telleth
All the future sitting
Sitting so quietly,
The mystery of the stars,
And the comets going,
And the new comets pouring,

And the meteors that were given,
The dim curse of man forgot?
What are those withering flames,
Those flutterings of scorched dust
That come when thunder is fewer,
When the low sun doth endure,
That wither thy braziers,
That dry up the essential fire
In all thy bodies,
And cinder all to dust?
What are ye, spirits of the air,
That ye be wast?

What, but the blood of your being
That doth ascend and descend!
What, but the eternal blood
That drips and loveth with the rest?
What, but the blood of love
That is the moving spirit
Of this vast sun and round it?

And the round earth that grafan out,
A mosaic gleaming with gods!
And the sea that low descends,
And the aerial lofty heavens,
And forms unseen in their schemes
All made best efforts,
When this great heart of the world,
This planetary earth does hurl
Crudely binding up its harness,
Out to bid astoot.

And its whirling ram, the gaily crad
Set on its pedestal with featly secured
Monsters quite equal all to itself,
Exceedingly fair,
And half the beast in symmetry,
With grandly single eyes
And half the face averted,
And all the body furled
And all its tangled furs removed,

And the faces of men turned outside
Into the Buddha faces, turned on its
face to the windy wall,
Where on an endless round, and in forever,
Are set like statues of the noonday snow,
All warding off the wind,

And the water-faces that do aright
Shine on the dark, and never stray nor change,
And every face that ever was done ever,
And every shape alike in the dew and the wind,
Flashes across the unfathomable night,
And every wind blown death's horizons,
And never wind-blows ever stray or change,
And the night is bright and the water is glittering
Over the unfathomable ethereal

With all its thousand faces turned to the wind,
As with wind stirs a spark of the sea,
Now higher, now downward, but ever fugitive and fleet,
Hanging in a halo, ever climbing the sky,

The Bull is but a frightful creature,
In any tongue, for any opinion.
Be one to him who speaks the truth;
The animal is man only too,
A creature of which man is not aware,
And, often, his very worst enemy.

A thousand names he bears besides ours,
The greatest numbsder of our language;
He, in the first of his daints,
Is met, in every colour and dress,
With soldiers, children, women, priests,
And every weakling under oppression.

An enemy to flocks and to bulls,
He takes on inauspiciously,
With regular will, the lambs and profits,
From kine and vessels, weights and vessels,
Hogs, calves, shepherds, cranes, and preparatory
Trade, he fares ill-alarming,
And almost bites the patient people.

A scourge, a weed, an abomination,
To parades among us fleered weedy youths.
They all are wagged when they are out of view,
With those who wagged before, with flaccid canards,
Among our citizens, for our calamity.

The show that follows, I know full well,
And will demand of you, old fellow,
If bull-pokoing be a fine entertainment,
When they wagged so wagged so woth, in the year,
When bull-pokoman and bull-pokomon was being
When bull-pokoes are now fresh and new made,
Four years, now fallen behind, I scope,
What comes after after after delay?

That after four years 'tis to be seen,
The tail, and the subjection, and the party
That follows and attends the tail, the party,
The party, who follows and attends all,
And the tail that cuts this way pursues and pries,
And the tail that follows that falls to entry.

Four years it has lulled the heart and the liver
That made hurt men pain, and the belly that made them sick,
And so following on, the paunch is advaced aright,
And, instead of stern pain that cut like a knife,
Since by sharp charges pain is disarmed and cut down
To ease like a harmless slice of the best butcher's meat,
They sit at meat, and a roaring stew of it.

And the tail drops, the subjection drops,
The stewed subjection and the parliament
Fall down, and they get up again, and go
For the honour of tail and the majesty of man
To see what parliament and parliamentarian be.
The parliamentarian first, or tail behind,
Or the subjection or the parliament last,
Or the tail, tail, parliament, or majesty, last,
They call the wags and wigs, and word them tailes,
And they dub it a waggon, and giff them wackines.
They call the, wigs and waggons, and leave all the pace
To saddle and box of tailes the subject and king.

And he is the subject and wigs and waggles,
Boxes and harness, and goes by turn another step:
He's a subjection now, and a parliamentarian,
In saunts and cities and open-handed;
He owes his fortune to shame, grace, maid or boy,
And stealing or giving, instead of good sense,
He's a subjection now, and a a parliamentarian.

And all the while he keeps on, and puts on tails,
And talks, and laughs, and he stamps and grins and talks,
And drinks hard, and sometimes glowers, and sweats,
And he'll swear and rave and do crazy deeds,
Like darting out, hitting and striking, up baring,
In verse like a lion, a poet like a bull,
He's a subjection then, and a waggoner.

"All the matins have done, bells ring,
All the churches rang----

Houd be made to help, but far and near,
Pity the master, and restore the Lord.

But let us pause; those keen and clamorous souls,
In whose thin voice the tone of life is seen,
The shout of strife, and prayer, have wrought such change,
That with the dead we come to all the man.
Did they not call us to scorn the shallow crowd,
That hides behind the gilded curtain?
And to our call for aid, should not the rich
Be consulted, and wealthendor'd minds,
Whose wealth consumes more than all their jewelry?
And is not wisdom, that statesmen's guide,
The rich man's duty, of all happiest type?
But wisdom is the yoke of servitude;
'Tis threescore and twentie! and they only mount
Whence would by words come down, but would not pay
The mean tribute of an humble wish.

Should they not raise their mockery to know
How by themselves they live, nor think the money spent?
How such a many years can make them blind?
And love, though fallen for paltiz  and gems,
Still lives so toward her children, and will so
To-night, if it could, where now each is others' wife.
And wisdom is caged in the dull clack of money,
Tis man's infirmity, and is equal ready
To starve, or in luxurier hands.

And as the hot-house shengese and frogfish marry,
So soon to come together may be done,
And at the last day's table, the empty can,
Like a cow-parsmant, lies beside the plate.
'Tis happy for us, of whom each day new lives;
The brimming looks of the milkmaid at none
Are lovelier than joyful visions of new lives
As I remember mine, that are to sing to this Tune;
Chorus new, not varied by the slowly changing skies.

What sense of terrors can excite mend
The heart, when the eyes of crowding people run
After the fire-plug, though high in air,
Which long has been in their glances tired,
And is suddenly made followleeping
By some new place or thing of help;
And, rather than be joyful, they may hate
Which makes them efforts lightly to endure.

But since I do not profess to follow
Elementes of geography, poorthofet,
And since indeed I'm rather feey to point the troth
Of such disagreement as museums elicit;
And since indeed it is hardly to be determined
Whether the spaniels' anemia is communicated
To their eyes, or darkened race perceived there;
While somewhat would-beast livers said I suits
The better parts of Spume, 'till Frye of broth;
I think 'tis time that one brought this to a close,
And if this Tale a little may agree with truth,
Pleasse to subscribe, and every one subscribe,

In answer to their requests that I 'd add.

The Cocke at last drawn thus gained his Theme,
And in his long discharge from the Malles (he made)
He much misgave the vain Deitists wistho
Were wont his words to scorn, wist he must grieve.
And wished this Sonant Magazine would bend
To his mold the balm of Rapé, and plume
The brow of so long a White's, who now to spae.

With a tap root fasten'd on a pin,
Each spade's come to rest in a kind of tomb,
Fretting that some auramite
Of the waxen shrouds 'twould explode at any prynce
Had been seen here every self-complacent wight,
And preened his goggle-face to be seen
And be o'r the shadowed curve of a broad billow.

And some were suckling yet, and some would be so
For more boot-box, under the earth, and sea, and sky,
Though knowest thou nought, nor gave they a moment's bliss
To gaze on the world, save by their dust-soon bellowing.

Scorn'd by the child of Phraethus, on his godhead biding:
For with a ram's head broad, and with a ram's eyes,
Bearing his double weapons, did he array
His head, and gauntlets of brass hew'd,
The very wind and weather forcing to obey.
Then, rushing to the place, away he throw'd
The aged champion, and a mighty rock behind,
A desert barren of the lake or stream,
And form of stone: as when an eagle flies
In all hands carrying through the air, and bore
A traitor in her bosom.

He alone
Who proved his worth and open'd with his blow
Such wilful defiance, that but one knight
Remaining of that little squadron
Saw his blade this day, and that was he,
Slain for the King.  As in the great hall
Of Hercules, when Pellitudos drove
To death Orrinus blood-stain'd, with a spear
Which down vicked him, "Nor more," quoth he, "though all
His peers should take and stab him, as they did
So one that day;" and such his grim applause,
That were their hearts from instead of sword,
The bow I say and arrow the like gory.

Nor one alone that day arose whose fame,
To us seeing, though not within, seem'd
Still to uplift the knight; one only boy,
And not the least known, movement, I ween,
Availing him, the shield was by him
Drew in that he cut off Antenor's arm,
And, like the wretch, for shame the weapon drew
And down he drop dear to his base fate,
Made waste, thrown slight by Eves' ruthless coach.
The other who that by his head was wall'd in
In double armour, such for vantage seem'd,
To meet the head with legs upbraid'd dilemma.

Meanwhile our kin to their losses have added
"Winner of worse prey," such triumph elate
That all those here encountered to us give,
A palm and a calf, where they themselves occupy;
Some say, "The Seraglio here that Iav'd
Is all of that Kings brethren," what equals they?

When I perceive that my verse cannot perchance
Avoid being suff'ring to read in prose,
I sigh, stop my ears and conclude my verse;
But if all hope not dislodged, but half at least
Seem better, steadier and more cheerful in you,
Then and only then will I attempt again
The desideratum, alterium pro sent
Which I so ardently in me love.

I did but feel, to see you cross and displace
So fast the Nimphs and the Sintian twins,
As stones that are struck from buildings height,
Or dusk shunning melts a last view of light.
Which easy virtue is, to see here and there
A welcome change and a fear of die,
So graciously lends place and new creation
To fill each marginal and deserted side
With something that is friend or foes.      (Le frereut Orfique et Omnis Imprimemus.)

But I have also felt, to have detect'd
Any change and sudden shock and sudden mishap
That made me perpetually forloy
The points of my breath and waste their powers;
To have proved mortal and brought undone
The utmost ace of all my fowl and beasts,
The nails and hair whereon my crown and crowncloth was.

Where as Nimrod, from beyond the winter-weed
Was wonderous far, and seeing that here
No moss grew on fagots, none could grow,
Though one had recently dying meant to wear,
To look about and see it, take and eat,
And there alone, after wandering all day,
Returning to his warmer and his last abode.

And was the one in authority,
The other, more tender, of the two, ironically,
But both had worked more than e'er they could of,
To bring its edicts and begin and end.

Both with tall impleasurete and erect eyes
Implacable and stedfast, to approach
The throne and both with voice and mark alone,
Both answering each with word which was not sound,
Nor look of sign but with a word both word and sign

Another is the world's delight;
I dream of human hearts that strive,
Of stars that seek the dawn of time,
And creation sweeping on from birth
Until its creation's goal.

You who are stalking them about,
And pulling them down,
Or, even you who are rising
To kiss them, and trembling
To taste the young, pure breath of life,
Who, too, are rushing,
Like battle-yellings heard afar,
Or sound of bells and singing,--
Who are standing
 Lost, even while you watch and waiting
Until the fates shall make you rest,

What do you hear?
-The tumult and eerier-bright
Delight of quiet lands and ways.
What you see?
-The whirlwind of the spirit-sea,
And thunders of the dim, dim land,
And tameness and the joy of crime.

The sunshine and the beauty and the love,
And all the freshness that's in things;
The gladness of day and night,
And summer's keenness and radiance given;
The divvle, dearest sound in all the world
That's born when we take a song;

The miracle of falling, that goes
And ever going, shrinking never;
The dew and sheen of any morning
And noonday, casting out serenity
But these are things that I've found
And know, and have;
And some are grey, and some are white;
And some a lot in between;
But all are wonderful,
And a most manifest part thereof

Time passed since first we met, John,
The perfumed crone that stood in all
The winding alcove under the shop,
The liquid beauty of her short loveliness
Before us, and the subtle way
In which she touched our ears with voice that shamed
Our wimpled lips with quivering sound
Was complete as any that stood
Inington or Abbey-trained;
And, when your mouth had Silber-sex repetitive
It clasped the dorsel and best of hearts,
I was in love, you gladdened my despondent heart,
With all the mad dearly loved that I had heard,
And all the more when proved and found
Valid for worse and less,

Love takes every shape,
If but eyed or recognized:
Love hides between the bark and grays
Of million trees:
Let me be a tree
And stand in the and radious

When my desires aren't satisfied
I'm weary, I'm weary;
And my joys, when they desire a thing,
Sometimes they contraire
What will they, will not;
They are as blind as I am,
And in a rags of black and white
I'm glad and displeased

With the unkind words of level folks,
And with the promiment of their friends,
Who have the habit of giving him his due;
And with the ungrateful remarks of higher men,
And too much attention to beg;
With too much neglect of to-morrow;
And too much neglect of making do;
And scarce enough of sleep at all.

If I could change one single thing
Of my face and their looks without a couter,
I shouldHave the furrow of life to wail upon.
Oh! I should be quite capable
Of unworthy sorrows, quite;
And my heart, which is as prepared a thing
As the desolate air of existence;
My top with the distemper of my existence,
Had hardly water for a foot.

But on the day that hastens me,
I would give up for the weariness
Of my sick soul the one fit,
Which is surely the last, of not getting anything
Or being less worthy the finding
Of what I want, to the possession
Of what I want again;
And I would give up all ill health,
And every disease and ache and fit,
And bear onstage the unspeakable shocks,
For the weariness of my existence.

It is thine, and not mine,
Her best-guarded and full light job,
For she comes therelike a femal power;
But all power none worthy man,
Except the power of doin' and pain.
She leaves us, and we find we're half-men,
When we look down deep in a primal place,
Half beasts, halfessains.
We're at war with abasement and blow,
And we lack the arts to slay the wild:
And yet we make workshops and arms;
The desire is there, but the will's blind,
And we must depend on her:

And the way, that he shall come into it, I know not, neither what
pile, of it has nowise been set thereon, nor whereof it may be
released. But if indeed I understand these things aright, it is
possible that when the Albatross shall have got into this
water, he will be spurred; for hoisting it from the branch into
the air is a work of more than usual tediousness. And
this at all events seems to me to be safe, if perchance the boat
shall be made of ivory, because of its having a porous inner
buffer-stead; for otherwise it will at once shut out the ship
from afar, by reason of the river. Wherefore a ladder
or an archer may help the boat with, which is better than a
stake of wood. If thou cast thine arrow on the block, thou
maltichane, thou shalt shoot thy rifle no more, if the
ship is left back there. And if to-day thou shouldst see that
the leader of this thy ships is leading such a daring life,
we do not acquit ourselves worse than with the bait of a black-
ingredient flint. We pity thee, world-wise Cipio, as one

Now at this moment my[B] commander-in-chief, Glauce,
appeared before the ships and men, whom she reproved
as she beheld them, and cut the head off of every one.
But when she had cut as much as was needful to give her
there, she gave each man half of a pound of meal and she
brought them all their life. Now when the turkeys are split they
let "speak" of them, and those behind the house have their
say, then they "bottom" with roughs, then "roast" or "fry" and
the eldest "hink" or two before them all, to make them all
smoke, and this last makes a good cheer. And thus she gave
us love, and we rejoiced at it.

When I had taken my revenge upon her, Lethe on the sinner
spake, if haply she might be led to think that I am
heaven-directed: "Not by earth[C] I journey, sage to receive
the benign impulse from thee: thou must send up a better
flame than thou hast provided; but if to thee of old that
cannot be found intoxicates thy creative hand now, we
are in the presence of a liar, who says it is no
good, for that the unprofitable among the useless will soon
be lost."[D]

So spake I, and about my finger-tips her sight was
so, the Duchess despatched her to me, with bitter invect
it was disposed, and for my hatred of the sin I
was exceeding hot, I, well worthy of the death, and
that without pardon; so spake she to the man that had

From a garland of oak

And the sun it shall glance, in the day

And it shall bow, with its troubles,
For the chase he shall lead;
And the sea it shall roll
For the chase to spur;
And the gallows it shall take,
Where it shall quit the steep.
And the salmon it shall bite
For the nectar it shall swallow;
And the fair it shall smile
For the red it shall suck;
For the mighty hunt to have won,
With its prizes so fair,
To have made a figure for one to grace,
As our woods we wot of?
O Lord, the people it shall bring
That it may hunt the hunt to its conclusion.

And the thoughts which to him were dear;
And for the joy which he revealed

And for the hope in her heart to have blazed,
And the face whereon it grew;
To have raised from earth its living children,

of this desert blue stone lake the size of two heads

to the cynical moist stiff brush of the saltbush bosc,
and the incredible growth of human scrub
that made bare the mediation of a practical jokesome worship
of mechanical brass and papery flowers
that stood, unkempt now, for ceremonial features
and of which I, with my own historical fingerpoint,
remembered the sacred figures
as white-cloaked clergymen used to do,
after a day's pathetic observance
of their utterly indifferent ceremonial politics
in the square fear of their membranmemed airs
above the mere aspect of the stars
(and, quite possibly, also the aspect of some little things below them)
while the historical audience, for whom that day could never more
be, watched the sunset wide and square
and the summer sun came on like a big already stupid star
with all the heavens steel blue now
and all the summer already known by name.

"Answers to the Invisible Birds", by Pimone Boyce [Nature, Animals, Weather, Arts & Sciences, Sciences]
We are still at your trial and not at theirs.
The hush any noise so the computers do not hear.
The little girl in the picture may have difficulty sleeping,
the wonders of what could be hidden
under your thin paper. Birds do not die at night.
Birds do not know when they are coming
and so they ask who are they?

1 Gor to rul. 2 Gor to lead. 3 Gor to sell. 4 Gor to preach. 5 Gor to blind. 6 Gor issued an arrest. The parish presses its claims. The presses return a blank. The church issued a statement. The chief at the station house operated the blank after the event. He believed his side had the better of. The press of flesh is printed. The press of flesh cannot be located. The Holy Terror's views does not match his. 7 The novel is not structured like a vat. 8 Gor has not the authority. 9 The master of the crop a good man. 10 The Holy Terror is an angel. 11 Gor is a lucky sower. 12 The farmer's blank comes to life. 13 The party's all in the paper. 14 The tenants see the light after the fire. 15 Gor's blood runs through a faucet. The faucet is not structured like a conk. 16 The Holy Terror's garbled. The system is not a tam. 17 The tract is not a question nor is it fully formed. 18 The master and the tinker have personal matters. 19 The poet's lunar walking is organized. 20 The essay is not a kolaching. 21 The merchant is not a beggar in the road. 22 The Holy Terror has no personal identity. 23 Gor has no pet in the way of meat. 24 The novel is not structured like a vat. 25 The tract is not question nor is it fully formed. 26 The master and the tinker are personal in the way. 27 The poet's walking stick is not a kalocus. 28 The peasant is not organized like a kalopi. 29 The press of flesh is a press of sorts. 30 The novel is not structured like a vat.

"Tussaud's Too", by Hanna Ben-Zion [Arts & Sciences, Painting & Drawing, Photography & Film, Social Commentaries, History & Politics, War & Conflict]
Tussaud's too, once a great prize,
a prized piece of canvas, now a thing

tractors' yard, a scratchy film broken
at its yellowed edges,
badly, all. Now, a curse word
breathed at an angle, a hoolie, now broken

too, standing for the damn black
power, the directing sun. All
citzens having the time of their lives,

dancing and posturing before the images
in their tired eyes, their tired minds.
Tractors, yard, and posturings, scratchy

and let themselves to the drunk and the sober.

And how many yards of that are left? Too

many to show any improvement, any clear progress.

In the suburbs, the orphans pick their way

generally here, a little wing to walk and a step

turning abruptly in the middle of your walk.
A mile from noon and it's afternoon.
And the street furniture advances from deep

hole in the side of the glass; the dwarf

and dwarf sprawl like phonemen

failing to identify you; and a gang

of girls in floor-length segways, side-

ning the cars in their own step along the struts

of full-grown women, crushed on all sides, blind

with lenses. And how many blocks? Too many to

get out of the way. It's the kids who do

the blocking and storing for the real estate.
All the young black bodies stopped

======================================== SAMPLE 310 ========================================

Jove and Atlas' mustering all the gods
Confirm the great oath, and bid not
The careful goddess of the hunt
Pursue the suitors in their flight.
But let the body, I command, be taken
Of the bold Telarov, and his arm put
Into the hand of one like mine, the swords
Of Meges and of Phrontes sharpen,
And the welkin shatter the shields of many
Betwixt it and the high sides of heaven.
Heaven, bound on fluttering aosann, wide
Turn round your clouds, and roar your flames;
So let the shiv'ring stars and white
Wings of the swift wheels of things be driven
Asunder, and let the earth draw iron quivers
From the burst belly of the high sea, and scour
From sea-spouts heaped with storms, and beakers thrown
Of fire. Seest thou not how from mid the heaven
Out burst the vivid purple trumpet's mouth?
So, when the best of horses hath oneotineth
The red boar or the grey mare unto pass,
With a little sputtering they wrong the prince.
Now may'st thou too, if so can do,
Of bestial nature free, dispense
The impetuous man, that not agnize
So swift of foot, but speedily
Cum informant, of what treasured hoar
Faults heaven has disposed of each and to seek?
So to the pale-faced gods he comes.
Thence soon we left the lofty rapture
Of northern gods, who, wandering equipoise
Among the gods' children, grew not strong,
But thus, assured, behold we, ere we leave
The godlike poet his own thready mind;
Thence seeking wings he finds them hung not high,
'Neath heavier pinions. But since in all haste
To tell my story, hither took I fall,
Abiding the chance of novel men
In mortal affairs: yet if a fair swan
Or sleep, which in mid heaven's gardens lies,
To him, be brew to, rolliothed in gold
His tale throughout the vale-landsres, I win
Greatest honour yet, for that my love's name is Mar."

"O thou, whom still growing love and chivalry
Strengthens; O thou chief of centaur and sire!
Now bids my worship be with thee termed 'lord';
For since the greatest and the best of these
Cannot but do thine equal wrong to kill,
And fight and die for cause he fights not, see
How much the best and worst is greater, less,
And ye are good and bad conjointly.
That which was highest errs also worst;
That which was worst errs likewise most
By that inclination; strong and impure
It were to bucklesh Anxterick, weak and vain,
Against God's counsel; mighty to invent
In heart-endeming bacs with blood and money,
And to endure for it in martyrdom
Stigma'd, while the other goes his way,
And sees no profit fruit of all, he posteth wide
To evangelize and to baptize; with prayers,
Bills, newspapers, his specificattsGoatus, in the village sq"av'd,
They call him; perhaps that name may old arbor "bless."
I Sappho read from Epodes li′st half-price pieces
T' enter 'neath two roses, there with head see
Bright eyes, and there witless titill'd, his head cut off.
He is grown wroth again, God 'twas his bier.
His head now red, a family tree requires
Deciduous death with flesh now ripe; this tip-dead
The weak joint'd matter is capable of mirth
For all the people in the land to come,
Thence mourns that end. The verse within its stem
Old Endymion cut, that none might defile
The body of Endymion. For when he fell
Endymion's blood haled his blood once more,
Into his lungs the ancient choleri breathed.

She 'rt the stronger, 'cause she 's so old.
What then? 'Cause she 's so old she flies.
My love 's so old, 'cause she 's so old.

So then they 're a quarrel of power.
Pierce the man 's a girl, 'cause he's so old.

There is no going back. 'Cause she 's so old.

She runs away. She runs away, my boy,
For there 's no going back. She runs away.
======================================== SAMPLE 311 ========================================
E'en now its pensive motion,
Its head erect in thought,
Was bending above the stream.
Its head was seen no more
Than a huge shadow ere
The beams of day' on the stream
Had fallen from their glory.
The song, 'mid the ships and rigging,
By the light wind was still sung.

How changed was now the scene!
The hope of one a child's darling,
Of one, who, years ago,
With family and friends,
All his leisure to roam;
Steers his native water,
Whom his mother adored!
The hush of solitude was
But an inexpressive silence;
To its aim insecure
No hand, though living, held a part.
When the iron boat drew near
It sounded as in the dawn
A distant locomotive.

At its mouth, in a dark cove
A pleasant little cove,
In the midst of sea and sky,
There it stood in its beauty;
There the shark and the kite
Were confronted by the display.
It caused no surprize or surprise
In those Northern seas;
It breathed death and hunger near
To those it strove to feed.

Heedless of creeping things that tracked
Its tracks through the moss on its way,
And all the larger things of earth
That would not be taken lightly,
In the scow that was sweeping,
As its tracking breeze- no more
A wave near the glass could detain
Its silver pace, on the glassy deep
Where it rode, for environment
On which no need of wind there might ride
But to a. remote horizon;
Its arch above them, the sun at its eye,
And its heart's-joy servitude, if it had one,
Were for its maximum of swiftness dashed
By a bare hillside, and its heels
At that ascent into the eve dark
Past the sands of a-warning sand.
Then it paused, in its action, to gaze
From the precipice played over by its wave
In the profusion of its brickwork,
Its rocky soil, its rocky hall.

Its journey, too, was directed,
Overturned, and reversed, and filled over
By the sandal's sand, from Vistula to
Yer while the curved boar's foot thrust forth
Far from any help of a shore- that
Wasn't "there," when the vessel that lay
Swayed from its bearing, and its sails,
Plunging to the breeze, did not rise
By a different direction.
But the time had sped the building
Of a hope in this talk to you,
Which might the spy to death go free,
As the vents to the warm air opened
With the rising of the fumes.

If the waters had betrayed the sand,
The very sands had told the sky
The darkness of its whiteness,
And the lessened prospect has been
The very instrument
Of a mistake or two, or ten
As the case may be, warranted
By the desert's Magian joy.
And in one's thoughts the question would
The mind transpose and meddle:
It has loved the blight, and now
Lets nature be the delayer.

It has been a weakness, and will be
Toil's by its fruits a fact, the root
Of which is Self-will, and no so!
Not an innate weakness, but a state
Ofal engenders that, by its hum
Of inspiration, working off
Energy put by feelings to fight
In its own nature so mixed and vast
Oppressive, when the upper light
Of dreamy sleep, or waking not yet,
With vividness revived, but new- eyed
Look from the camera-eye of Health.
If this be true, I don't know which,
But it seems to me both at once:
The blinder mind and overbearing
Psychic sign of so much animated
Possessiveness that it owns not yet
Its own ABSENCE to clarity.

I told you once of two castles lone
Near the cliffs of Teruel, towns of Gaul;
And the Burgundars there, and the Roman
Tracts sold to the Tatians, and the
Polkat LazeanANS of Verity
With shining garments and marmite
In the land of the Lartians, and that Lucis
Unmasked made.

For the inarticulate forest I mean,
The clearing woodland, clear as in a graphite
Cloud, where ever previsions of every
Human creation fill our souls
With apprehension; for in truth the mind,
Whether of foreign or of domestic lease,
Is a region where great actions be,
Or at least
======================================== SAMPLE 312 ========================================
 and weary wanderer, who lately had glided
Thro' the bliss of childhood and childhood's slumber, to rise
A creature newly forged, awake with all new desires
And hope, the restless mind re-stunned by fresh shocks.
A song of summer, then, was not a thing to savor,
Except in metaphor.

And this man
Was once so simple that he sang to this girl and this
Amazing melody, while the echoes pealed round the rocks
In glee:

A long, long way
From home he stands, as if he seemed to stand alone,
Holding, like stars risen, not his but man's breath.
The summer day was cold, when he stooped at last,
And saw, first, his mother's garden smile at him,
Then, strangely, believe she was seeing a dream,
Lifting her hand to give it back; and so it was.

As heroes wear,
With keen awakefulness to live, the man did shine
Among the dead, shrinking from the death-fulfilled sun,
Not half so coldly as yet, he felt a corpse's hands
His blood and breath: he felt them, for one time
To make him really stir, and wake; he felt them in part
For real, for his soul, for what the body could not be.
The man was young, the man was brave when heard
Of armies counting their banners, he knew not hate,
Hatred, ever present, hovered as a careless eyedene.

So soon was he a man that, on the battle-slope,
Ulysses' son beheld him, and was he that very day,
Charged with a torch, or plucking purple Cowslips from a bier?
In such of his actions as one who had seen them say,
"Thus as our father here has done, a great lord was he."

And thus he spake,
With much vermilion in his very crimson nasadie,
And Aphrodite's self smiled to hear him praise his sword.
A little farther reached the man, when once there he stood,
And, turning as it were to receive him,
He felt a kind of glorieshine, which made him quite gay,

So, too, methought there rose up in him that famous energy
Which winners of things allow, like that which from an heath
Brushes** families to rally round a trophy's summit,
And, what might better have been labored to be described
As double herring or single,**,* had not art been done them well.
His clear and single eyes,---so the old sow cheated by a term,
(*My dream's parrot, who cannot have enough of her fish 's fat)
Could yet view a better than the gladsome sun;
His good and great, which hide for him in a myriad gems,
Were more than her and all by scope of his own dear life;
And though in their own order they are placed and enclose,
As they belong in a gallery of everlasting notes,
He could behold, and, knowing such, could relish and taste and sing
The confluence of their glorious relations, which is not more.

Sweet Soul of Life, shed thy lilac dew
On what thy life has started from:
I pray thee that thy spirit loves
Not such regret and aches as mine,
Whose blood my hope has judicially drawn.
Not such regrets--but, Sweet, dear Soul, stay!
What if I should turn away?
But stay (Sweet, dear Soul) and come to me,
Where thy pleasure's luxuriant stem
Tempts the quick streams with smooth praises chime.
I fly not, nor would prolong you out
My number'd time, but have life so short
That, waiting should my heart, much pleas'd, kill Death.

No lash, envenom'd Passion, mistrust
Betray'd not what is most encrypt (by to-day
Bent with poor metaphors) in thee—
(Even in my sighs the flame discloses)
That thou hast brought my last embrace,
O Soul, too firmly cling'd through gloom and stress;
(Still rul'd with pure condition, though dire sport
Weigh'd the serious facts of my fate).
O, well--but, O, be it so!
Live, fortunate Lord, out of subtile tact
From all purely remote—say, delicate—
Part, deliberate, quick cause and wise goal;
And I a few years fewer, from my years.

in an earthly temple but sought
the communion of pure thought in

The hour of our Pilgrimage shall come.

Not as the Gentiles pray

with hand on head

they still content and rest,


As the Christians of old

slept, dreamt, and sang,

Happy, before the shadow of

Sin loosed on the world.

That dream is over

The love of our Pilgrimage

Awakened our love

We dream as they dream

Deafened yet

as they dream.

All our dreams of those who died

are over and will continue

As they have eternal

reward.

draining the pear

from his bosom,

To cleanse it

till his own bosom

would not speak it,

And all the world,

whose bosoms are tainted

from the same source,

will hear his poem

for free:

No sin me bier kunde,

Derstein häufte

ist sie soll,"

for free.

Where the shadow of Baldur

of Helm's power

breathes early at the scene

of the final blood,

where Ráma's arm

has torn down Yudhva's tower,

my love

hymns of storm and prayer
were mad and rampant as
the male snake that caught
her for a while
and let her go
purple and golden

lying leisured as a

gold upon matúra rubbaba,
an excellent story
behind it
sat one
with a
great sword—

For a month-long trough
of sixty days
at the footings of his house,
a king of the beasts
knew his two-legged companion
sat on his hand

mad and fantastic: prays
for storm to destroy
everything—

The cat, the crow

with surprise and injury,

and heard her lips

she sichtily prayed to be delivered

from his graces—
she prayed for his love, her soul
and her nurturance,

I have said before, as I heard her
saying in her low voice
in a frenzy of wish, her belly red
and her fur wet
that those baths
of water were a gane of pains—

How she wanted to be delivered of pure life,
a life of pleasure,

may have been
mad to have an every wish,
caught in a circle of pain
at the bottom of which was Hell,

walls of jhapûkaç,
a mad jeweled bottle

Lying with her on the bed, they found
The head of it protruding from the heap
A little way off; and, as dreams
Impend upon the wandering of dreams,
All those around look'd down from their windows.

I had been thinking, there, in that close room,
On my unvisisted fury; and my eyes
Faded away, and the movement of my mind,
So I had not noticed, seemed to flash
And fade away, nor remember having been;
Till the freshness of the great daylight
Came, with a light, that had a new beginning,
To drive the slumber from my weary breast,
And drive the pang of the fresh little morning
Within me, till it beat and beat, and beat.

The loud naked feet went out and in;
The gay bare legs went in and forth and out;
Till the very palfrey found no tongue, or voice,
To love or hate or any fond trade; it slept
In the heart of me, which was all one fire,
And made of fire the bed whereon it lay;
And so it tickled, even when as a fly
It tumbled there, into the heart of me,
As sharp fingers tickle and play on wire,
And sleep and pain returned, and sleep and pain,

It flashed across my forehead and my lips,
And sleep and death and deathless nightmares flew,
And sleep that is a god and love and love-rage,
And beauty that is the nightingales and dew;
And beauty and love and love-rage and dew,
And sleep and death came trickling in with them,
And all that was, and all that was good to me,
And all that was—and all that was good to be.

When youth runs swiftly, by the help of Heaven,
I find the spring-time in this hour of darkness;
It is because, when youth runs, it does not look
Backward for the vanished smiles that were, not even
To glance and catch the light of something that was,
It is because it runs without a look behind
That it can reach to its old pasture and come back,
And look in the same place and see the same things:
Because, when youth runs, it runs without a waste,
Over the same grass that was well and well and well,
Over the same downs that were well and well,
Under the roofs where in the dark they grew,
Under the green old grass that was well and well,
Over the grass that was well and well and well.

And now I know that I am one of the oldKeough; I know I am not young or good or worthy or blameless,
But that I shall return, and that I am not loved or heeded,
For how will I be worthy of it, but the old blackKeough that has marked us and set us off from the beginninjour of time,
That is marked us and weaved us and knit us in his fosse;
I know I am not beautiful, handsome, free from flaw,
As someone who is to be buried soon,
With my dead manhood and my life's practised wit,
I am content to Praise today as the sum of my days;
And I know I have got what I lost when I moved from the beginninjour of time,
And when youth ran like water, made me life unworthy of its liabil;
And I know I am not new or hard or rich or glad or sad or good,
But only lived like a living man of the beginninjour;
And I know that I am not worthy of man's daily breath
Nor worthy of the things that are to come yet to me,
And I know that I must rise and go to the dead man's sleep;
And like a dead man I shall stand, hand of face, and stare,
Staring death in the eyes and pressing it with my palms,
With that sinking feeling of inevitable death,
And the sunk heart, the body, the lifeless hand that I am wont;
And I know that if I had been born yesterday,
Or if this was rolled away with the tide
That is bound to me with the decree of fate,
Still I must eyesaddled and aching on the stream,
Wrecker'd and confounded, and I am bid to kiss
The morrow that I shroud her and my stream.

Dew!  The ending of the far-away dream of day.
Dew!  The dew with my despair is laughter unawares.

Sweet Grace! is a divine
Which might reanimate
Some of the grisliest
To ease their pillows.

I'm not at home in this
Metaphor to trace
Its next friend, but waft
Some of its wind of tone
O'er the interval, to kiss
The ear we miss, henceforth

If Love's a water and Joy is a fire,
And we are specks in the sea of the crazy sky;
Sweetgencies are magnifications
Of passion and of tenderness;
The wind that ripples the glassy seas
Is but the mad fancy
Which the wind invents forReason!

How radiant and fragile
And loose are these thoughts I carry!
I see not the huge walls of big ideas
Whose feet is as a pestilential vortex;
And I'm afraid this fragile herb
Which is reason and which is sense
Is no better than the fearful fly
Whose crippled body gives notice
Here's the way he comes!

Whose vaulting ideas and his dizzy brain,
And yet the frail flesh is a hard clay
For the dear thing to put in!
The dear thing to put in!
For life's fair now, my dear thing,
And peace shall be spread before thy hollo!
Shall I live here or die here?
The damn'd!

What's left me then?
A. The fly's brain;
B. A candle;
A fine peaceful candle!
Or a quiet, cowled scholar's grave,
Or a forked, lit lantern;
Or a grave by some liquid stream,
Or the damped murmur of a rill
Which the dull scholar spies
On a dim valley's edge,
Where a stream, once one gurgling draught
Of the sort which the grim record steals,
Perchance, from the desert sands,
Spreads aromatic hey
Like ancient wines among the hills;
Or a grave by some quaint echo found,
Where a mourner, after the shade
Of the mournful one or dreary minaret,
Sings or silently groans
Or sighs
In the green shade of some softened leaf,
Which the wan bee once was used to gather,
These foul fancies to lucubler
Of a poor leech or pale beggar,
Who, hard beset,
Lonely, among the hellebore leaf,
With a venom'd tooth
Against the recent kiss of the gale,
Was (all things considered) only trying to get
The mellow spirit to put out of his eyes.

Of the burial, (bear in mind this sage doctrine,)
The priest, whose office is like that of St. John,
Is an idler far than I, nor can admire
19th-century jesters, nor can watch,
In the bosom of his room,
One perspicuous section of a fine passage;
He must walk unperceived, (and we have already
learned from calomely concealed glances, that he does.)
Nor can he, thus idle, to the misery of his prayers,
Revive old memory with dream like this,
Which is also idle, but the other was merely sad:
This we have still more easily taken down.

But truly to keep open house, there are some thousand doors
Which still magazine in like conditions, as if under French,
And many of these have now and then a whiff
Of rain, a moment before it all departs,
And fate to humor brings in pinks, or makes an unlikely god
Lounging in the sun, who was almost certain to be
Just when he appeared, the right person was refused,
And so the snooty intruder was not arrived.

The failure of one legal exception
To keep true money with our one true money,
And one pretext for the other, have given these
A green for attempted theft.
We, therefore, must be one in whom the others fail,
And there are many of them, I believe,
Who should be in, but will not be until
All those old thieves, that are not, by the sweat of their face,
In the green of their own skins, alive and in the clean air again
Are put to feel the prison that their fire could befreeesse.

If we had only a single tree
For our sole use, and if
We themselves had no use
For the earth in all her kinds
As in their own lives, and if
We none of it consumed, yet
All should dry up and expire;
Livings free from the fountain's assistance
Would be stunted, and the earth themselves
Would be a mine that no

Or both--but to me!

And 'Dunk' accepted as 'Lod';

Which the world calls poetic, and which is none,
The 'Hinterland' trots off to the next blow-out,
And gives the finger to the blows--'piff-ball'
To the Persian and Hindoo who likes German!

As 'Uranian' cross and 'Altruist' spoon
Will for a while add some "oment life" life to
The glory of the infinite, to the background
Of the mere background of things, no doubt befitting
The latter god of variety and ball,--
So gay, happy.  'Neath the cross and spoon
The cross and spoon will give the gradient
And ball of all things which can be counted on one's
Thumb-finger, more 'trim the finger of your pen'
(Cf.  The Nurse, who is 'touching' the sick, but up
The filmy vision of getting ready for going to):
I, in the shelter of some laboratory
Of a few trinkets, read my death and return
At the end of September, when the first
Precipitate bubble lights up in the brain
A 'Tacitimo,' a 'Nuncio,' and an I.

I had a nephew who lived down in New York,
A techie, as his position would warrant;
And one night while he was almost at the end
Of the street from being walking down the row
He in a moment had by him, as he might,
The property in New York and the world.
For it hit him in the ague time that the 'tips'
Of people he knew, of known acquaintances, told
The cause of this wild glee, and he could not say
What the contents might be of a letter which
Is mailed from 'CTR' to the parents' address
And awakens the envy of thousands, and sends
The watchful landlord, at the weekly rates
From one up there to cry 'Solution!'

He bagged it all as it might be dangerous--
Evidence, even--and none the less imaginary--
And opened and rifled till he 'had a charming
Items of news and remarks'--but these he 'locked' up
In 'a box of mended jewsos,' and he
Lent the rest out to the newspapers as his notes
Which he 'took pains' to send by 'the rectum'
To his doctors 'at Cornell,' who were 'exception'
To all, save Professor Ferguson, who was 'smart,'
Because he would act like a scientist--
That is, bringing his periodic table,
As gold Scotch evening papers make sunshine.

And so the world was misled: for there are none
Who study or flit at sight of innocence
In youth, and bonzes, is, or lilts, are not
Turned to panel-writers of popular verse
While they may have something in the family
That has become a topic of fashion
(It is just a girl or boy that has made it a
Song and its story has all to do
With something after nothing more than 'twas
He or she wore or left behinds--but
'Real life' has not yet been invented).

For he was pitied not as a vain thing,
For he had been at times but stopped such pride,
And been sadly beaten down by them
Who see and know and possess the real:
The hero of his tragedies--
The good obozy who everybody knew,
But in whose legs the little popsicle
Forced of fate a wayward path of tardy
Contingency, from which he always ran
With some touch indefinate, ever on
Unequivocally the look and like a spectre
Slowly may be seen descend the stairs
Up to the top, up field and golden-light,
As I draw you a sable hand eerily
Sixty years ago this morning, holding the hand
Of her I now may never hold, and now, I doubt
If she will let me partake of her ease,

======================================== SAMPLE 317 ========================================
 classic hero, the prophet
Of the sainted Spain, Francisco;
Through his youth and his full growth.

By the light that reveals
The second genius of the age,
I glorify his soul and name,
And praise his mighty mind and spirit,
And his great oraceache,--
Taught, by the gifted soul,
That inspired him, through life,
To wield the intelligence
That rules, through life.

Aristotle's faith, for a time,
Sent trembling thinkers wild,
And baffled bards, with visions cancelled
Of ancient prophets gone.
Some pretended spiritual science
Breaking the walls of nature's cage,
Some strained from magic aither
Full strength of the Druid lore;
With all a weary faintness sent
Under the burden of magic;
Even the sick man's home-willed lore,
Once so comforted, now bears only small
All faith of the prophets old.

Nay, great Atoms, that had gone down
To earth, as gods,--I sing, O me!
Through pain and through defeat, to meet
That day with hope and gladness.
But this too, as sometimes here we see
A peak escape the storm that blasted first,
So, too, strong Atoms, going down, were driven
To pass the day with gladness.

I see, again,
The old sage Object of our worship,
That, first of men,--the greatest now,--
Complains that our numbers are too low:
He holds that to begin with
No units were number'd, so that word
screwed Nature over heel and toe.

In such old battle, I hold,
The matter could not be right
That through the columns run the arms
Not as one weapon-arm alone
Swings out the rest; those wheels that turn
His forces well might strike, the rest,
So width is in the length of each.

In such old battle, I hold,
The matter could not be right
That the angles be such that groups
Make confusion on something real
(Its reality, its numberless Command
Lops up seed-beds,--leaves neath them crushed air!)

So that the enemies of Christianity
Should by this scorde turned militant be shot,
Arm'd,--should kill as they,--and that charge
Be to the death,--on that day, be thou!
For in the time of apostasy,
The only weapon, good news to that Arm,
Is thine, my Father! that thou say'st my Spirit.
Thou know'st it, for, when thou wast compelled
To talk about Spirit to our kin,
Some speaking it, others refusing it,
Some inclined to scorn, yet others exploding it,

And still some loving it,--in slight acquaintance,
Working methods, drills, basics,--with a Staff
Deep in the bosom of that Chartres Temple,
Thou know'st how the Devil makes this Craft,
Mating upon pain to its breeding,
Driving countless souls to divert them
In misery for two or three years,
Then in the worst of moods draw them down,
As forcers bound in knots "officious,
Driving them deep down--a smile and pout
Rip off the split in the neck, and, straight
As before, drive them to the cart's body.

Thus my sage thought thus in itself divided,
Thought itself divided--went its way.
My thought, my sainted mind, its'n. O whence
Should this conceit mortal see?
The burden long since Atlas' son to me
Bore when a child, at the trumpet hear.
This quail! This quail!
Pushed on by fear of living death,--
Do thou turn! Quail? That such a thing
Should be. The thing is, how I prove it.
My whims! Fears! My votary, votive thoughts.

What if, as thee, I grapple with mayonesse,
With its wild struggles merged in its soul-sayers;
How often in the wild woods will I hear
The woods summon thee to death! How often
In the midst of thy praises will I hear
The mouth of the forest, its torches unfurl,
While, to thine eyes, a ghost of water
Drives up from the waves, which is the path to
the mountain-ridge, that eternally
Sway'd by wind and fire, and roll'd in the way,
The wind's way, the fire's way, the breath's way,
The dream's way; O how would it shake each wheel,
Impatience bending the axle on high

To take in and put in
The latest word from Arthur,
That they could do no more harm.

The heathen, looking one way,
A mighty land did see,
And next day report him blind
So stout they could not rest.
The light one way, the other
 his friends so often called,
Said that the heathen land
Was where men were left to grind
On all the rings of iron.

"Now," the Emperor said, "if I
Was at one from deep to low,
I would not seek on this palm,
Where so much is left of me,
To satisfy the whole of you.
I want but little in this,
My sitting in this sun,
My going to and fro,
To answer only one world of two.
The solid stone, the air above,
The water, all the land, in one
Do as you may."

He bade them take down the wall,
And down it came,
An unbelievable thing,
A great bridge of stone
So heaven-stable,
So firm-as-oak
That the pass would not disedge,
But keep in memory
A wall as old as earth.

They took it down and off it went,
An unbelievable thing,
A great wall of stone
Now house'd where Baptist Church stands
(A church that betrays the tympan song;)
And heaven-symantec'd it to from below,
House'd it to keep from heaven,
Did not the Rocks so easily
Steal out of the biggest Of Big-brook?

And now they've censor-ed down
The warlike ravagings
Of the Rabblets of Ruggers,
Of the little men that want to be
Great artists, and so
They have undoing of their parting
For their viocations,
And have forever censor-'D
The Church Railway to run round,
Where the folk are so mighty stuffed
That the Witts are now and then
Died, leaving Honig-Holand,
Which evermore it must never
Steal out of the Wittsonian roof
Till frost be permanent no more.

What shall the saddest things of all
Be, of all the things that be?
And the light that the larkant is
Sings to me like a song
That was once by the mill-water,
By the right track lost, and heard by
My boy who was me,
And now I must will ill to stay
In the limen time;
For when me and thee be down
In the living sort of loam
Below the wreathed green coke,
Bright loveliest things will turn a trick
And gobble us at, 'tis feared.

In this world of doattin' and droorackin',
Of dooshapin' and dodorrillin' -
Of just 'cause to 'at I 'tak' the 'at,
There isn' one that jeers at a crack -
One gits the spirit right aglow,
And speaks him sense -
Jewie, Western push, and ungenerous,
As it is every year,
And always heaviest on the people.

'Peared of a man's daughters,
In ancient China,
Selling them, and bearing in their hand,
In good time, a tol-stone white;
And, in their eyes,
A row of such choyce books of shame.

Merry it is, at any rate,
To have one's treasure in hand,
And lighted, like a fairy lamp,
On a stitched-up house by realts
Of poetry, as in that one
Which the sea-sull had once, and seen
Untossed, straight out on the sea,
And not in the bedroom at all;
And, in our eastern grayner,

Well, it glows we believe,
A candlestick in a crack
To the eye alone,
While to the eye,
And to the other,
The merrier it shines.

And who would not take
High cause for historical purpose,
And make
Out in a snapshot,
All bizarbed like a bill
For mess to people's names;
And write
In a book;
'See books for books,
Write to write!

And how perhaps
We have recorded Nature,
And what we say
Of the seasons,
Should have respect
To the law
Of Human Action -
All not to do
For man is man,
And to not do
For animal is beast.

I have wound me up, so let me turn,
And I see, near the

on her way to the seat of the Cherubim,
pursues her footsteps, calling, "Child, the future
hurt you! If I had not fled
my home, you would have turned in your cradle
to me, my son, to my sister, my daughter;
the heavens have given you a happy
life, to enjoy it till men and angels
do requit with their ruines, and now we
say farewell because of the iniquity.
And so you will leave me, and never
without me shalt another woman take in
as great a pleasure as mine in all my days.
But above me turn, O child, and run
far as thou mayest reach of thy way,
and note the words of thy father
for God hath given every bird its licence
even down to the floor of the Pleiades,
and none of them with thee tortures
could help thee in thy generation,
possession, or thy share in glory.
LORD, I was a sinful woman in the house of my husband.
I laid bare my head against the affliction
upon my one good husband, as he was
cast into prison for the crimes of many
lifetimes--a holy man with a righteous flag of triumph
in the house of his virtue and good
possessions, bright with the blessing of kings.
But ever the mouth of guile was opend to mine,
and they was full composition that they swear
verbatim by them they did not think
better of my good husband than other honorable friends
But here is the test:
the wreath of the laurel,
the leaves of the laurel, the bay braid
of the dog--and the marriage
is between the breaker
and the rest.

They were full testing me, my lord,
to see if I would be a dish- mate or
bickering in the house of the family,
to be the comer or the knigge of the host,
or the generous of the wife.

But the angels of God took delight
in the work, for they loved it that I was
fulfilling the mission of the organ,
the task that was theirs of task of offering
freedom courtesies in the family circles,
sound in homes, clear in spirits,
honored with the good name of son-presbyter.

And I have the keys of the Cannery
to do God's work in the homes of men,
homes of grace and glory, and as much
as I may I will go abroad and build
a ship and fields of dwelling
for the weary ones of the poor
of the poor worldwide
as the inexpensive apostle
of Jesus, my gentle namesake.

"An Address to Kids", by Melvin B. Toy [Living, Parenthood, Relationships, Family & Ancestors, Religion, Faith & Gay, Judaism, Arts & Sciences, Poetry & Poets, Social Commentaries, Youth, Mother's Day]
The children are within,
They are small and straitly wed,
Their mother is behind;
Their father's in the field,
He takes his orders in the dark,
His women work in rows;
They are efficient without thinking,
Insight is denied;
Their head is wholly thick and very ugly,
It lies about with squinting;
Their ears are turned as the suns,
They have not time to twitch;
They use no spices or other things,
They do not think outside thebox
They do not know the use of writing;
Their lives are purely destinies,
They wed within their parent's home,
And take their spouse's virginity;
They have no time to think it good
To rub the hands of strangers;
They think it good enough by fast,
They know they are husband and wife.

"Night of Terror and shaking Hands", by Jacob Skinner [Relationships, Family & Ancestors, Nature, Social Commentaries, Crime & Punishment, History & Politics]
Now, comrades, we who hold
Apprehension of the crime
Know by insight know
Why terror heavy was the air
That froze Mrs. Shively

To slumber on the snow:
Poor woman, a fine balance now
Of evil and good needs seeking
Of Attila, the ruthless,
Or his like upon her;
For at least a vital part
Of frozen her has been recov'd,
Not quite restore to fall,
But rather pierce the battlefield soon,
And freeze at her instance.
Now with this fragment known,
See what it awakens;
For first of all it tries to show,
That it was Beowulf's day.

Steepèn now, before that [i.e.]
Virgilian wisdom: which is no
Aude, but fire, and fire is God.

Methought, I said, my head doth turn,
To see the lightnings, as they pattern,
Each doth his flaming leap on I;
Which lends [i.e. O to] his shape.
Thus, meter'd, they appear'd, as though
A flame, a star, or Pallas,
A starling, or an augur:
Each would be red, all red-remembrance.

Methought I was alone,
Alone, as I had been
In OMBER's court, or LORDE,
In BATHLY'S fair parlor;
As one, who, out of Doors, went oute,
And would be hide to crave
So hote a heart as thine;
Or, as one whom his harts prov'd,
His eyes like Titan's are.

'Tis not like to meet at all, to say I
Was not a fountaine while I've live;
But have a child, or have two, or three,
I've made a holy trine
(Not so long my wedbe is to run),
With equal quing, which then I did knowe,
Which th' one, and one, and one, did knowe.

It now behooves me with carefull look,
To take off rid provendraions
From mine inmost firming;
So that my frippery may not obeyed be,
And I do not thinke I oft can spue.
That my wit is over striech,
I like it well, and still more do feare,
(As those whiche trouble their riches).

I am the bl. of the gloss. of the poem,
This is the good report too;
Full tenderly I like to lerne
In one, which can speak, and be lieg.
All the joys of the worldes wide welle,
A goodly poem, seemly true,
Must as soone be referred to me.

That which to me gave pure Maiestie,
To heare so, as I may not sleep;
Since which I can no way but li me Towre
In yearely, or do or do not;
My doel, which nevere yet had mate,
Can now for none but you consent.

And what to ensue lets my verse,
Since th' attyre of it now is ripe.
Thus more, since no man ever thought
I coulde, of pure entairie anglics
Or e'r can, espyr deare affection,
Which maketh me content and sweet.

Let no time or ment to me remain
Unloveable,
For I, desir'd,
Will it all besiege my mind
With your beauty, that I may
Unto my soul persevere;
Even your sweet divine content.

This message privily shall come
To your heart, that is not damp'd;
And then may run
For grace efficacious, whare-in-sorrow
No heart may reach.
Let not Wicked men reproach
Us, but each one humbly stand
Before your Beauty, that you see
To heal, and bathe in her showers.

He is not loath'd, but in his thoughts
Dreams one to another caught
Up to two-footed things:
Her, to whom he's constant and kind,
Seems to borrow light gear;
And they from whom to him she partakes
Her honor, admir'd and loath'd.

Yet (climate and climate they nor hold)
That he by th' effects might not speak
Nice respect, nor for one day
Fair warrant of him would waste;
Yet was his back towards her turn'd,
And on his face he fixed his eyes
Closely beside, like those whom torch-lights glance
At half-arm'd knights who face the battle.

Lo when the thing is duly try'd!
To her a fifth his suit already
In confessing pallace;
And he will be her princess soon,
And King also, while lovers dream;
Or even now his rage is hirks
That so it be not done.

He will excite for his display
The fifteene, and to suit herself
Already he presents her
With two new titles, which are sweet
And magnificent, and she
Is one ofoute Landorf's Princesses
That have imperial crown:

Her second alias she calls

"My father-table!" she cries,
"For so to set it, only,
"Will the birds and small beasts flit,
"And the children hold it dear,
"By the lamps at the door-step,
"By the darkness in the cave,
"Wherever it is, let it go!
"Sorrowful is this table,
"When it shall take the place
"Of the night-table so fair!
"My father will come and eat,
"My father will bring me food,
"But the witless host will never
"Arouse from the deep-sea's foam!
"Only the fishes of the market,
"Only the children's darling thing,
"Coarse bread for the big fish fed,
"Will come near, and talk the live-long day
"Of the hunter and his quill.
"Let the table meet his sight,
"Let it bring into the room
"The new sense-looks and taste-feeds,
"And the house-sides be again made,
"And let the old seats be seen
"Beside the doorway and the cave!"

Six days have this tables's light gave o'er,
Six daily worked this lamps' temporary rays;
But on the seventh day,--at day's end,
When the gable-cliffs grew dark,
He who in some strong-robing salvers kept
The household fire alive, heard in the shrill drone
Of the sharp fit that pride of flame, which whelmed
And perished in the fragile glooms.

At last the land that on the waves is grown,
And thick-aughed chains restrict the stream,--
Hath her conditions set them by, as we,
Our safe retreat from those dark vials swept
To make them our new home. A drear war
Gives our rough hearts fuller to the smart,
The small success is hard to make good,
Mopingly we try to drive at last
The clear-figured worms, the sullen bugs,
The waxen, unresponsive elephant,
That in this one short but arduous fight
Trembles the now familiar hand that now
Frights to a lesser venom.
The progress of science (and man's mind
So to advance it) may quicken this,
But not accelerate; still the art,
Pushed by the case, still worships the wrong!
Progress therefore shall proceed, but not
In progression; in this life's bud and flower
Progressions may be framed as they seem,
But not in things that are not made
By those we, as living, scientific men,
Stand often, as in search their chief:
I do not say, how far,
That so much has been done before
To guarantee might yield good; nor, how far
A farther further, the limit free.
We cannot with any hope or fear
Take thought for very space of the gulf
To come, nor of that lasting dread,
What man more may not gain than others.
The prophetic great, when at his height of wisdom
He fortified with a world his mind,
Standing on the verge of all he Born and Found
Said, for his heirs the rum was good,
Which, spread before him as a space
Full dense and certain,
Accordant, like a scaffold vast,
Filled all his exploration of the world,
For all knew he as Man, and a Man
Might well do even though mad were he,
Celestial, and incredibly erudite,--
(At once; for this doctrine upset
The House of Holderness, and made all search
And busy study and deep plot of Scripture,
So bloated it was with doctrine,)--
What lunatics have been at heart,
He said, and said no more.

He took the Standard down, and a huge span
Of weather-field, like an April sky,
Marred it. He gathered up his wistful quiver,
The matches that swayed it, his old afternoon's sigh
Of bestial gaze he kept, the rage he had,
And stores of modesty and father's name
Threatening Him as to withdraw his presence,
But not his pity. The Door of Blood
The Door of Disease, when his Masterspite
Himself, open, as it did on the day
He seem'd to bring in, when he cried patient hear,
And spoke long parts, and said as one who has
His coming words, when no one else dares.
And still within that kind of mind,
Out of his own difficulties free,
He began to weave and permute,
Of thoughts that grow like mist, the deluge

Wer'n to any ten, we think as we;
He is both sage and witty, and that's worth a crown,
And in his works you'll find no things that are dull;
It is not, like other men, a somatic disease,
But a learned one, and a profitable one too;
For no one ever learned a thing, and could do,
That had not already seen the doing once.

Now every day a beast appear'd with a perpe,
And every day we set up a fair apograph,
And make believe for our wants were unfortunately none;
But our wants were an empty form without a back,
That a back might be for the tenners and hones,
And all purposes ready to go at last.
Our cause we took up in all her magnificence;
That we might have our dear ideal of home;
But there was only one in all the street,
And when he came he made no such surprise,
As one who should be used to such calls and crowds.
We told him we were persecuted for our crime;
But there! had she but thought of that last confession!
He bowed, but had no time to get in much more,
And shook his head, and that was all--and so we went.

A girl--I hate to say it--yes, a girl--
Resolved herself into a glass of beer,
And sipping slowly down, took up with fire
Of change--yea, determination utterly;
And turning solemn, turned to the press,
And the cursed charge that may wonders to make:
"I have reason to know there's a heaven above,
And I have reason to believe there's a Hell.
Why of course I want to believe there's a heaven,
That's an old one everybody, at last, fatigues:
But I want to know one way or other, too,
If there's a Hell, or if there's only space fornone."

Himself got up, and shook his head at times,
And said, "I'll be frank with you, Miss. friends,
I've had my fill of them shroud-like 31
days, and there's no chance, you may swear,
That will affect to warp or cometh no thunder;
But no one knows; and I would hate to be all alone
With little sunshine, or little night, or--well,
One little wink from whoever it be."
The old woman, too, had her moments, and tried
Her stake for the black-eyedicipated year:
"The more to do, the more to be out of breath;
Gaun to take the wrong way, I'm certain to trot.
That dear meat (phew!)--I haven't a hoorink why;
But there's trouble, and beheads, and Lord knows
If I'll ever get back in the same state I was."

A sort of measured success in all sorts of things
Is just about the sort of thing we're fitted to bear,
And you're fit for it when you've had your fill of booze;
It gives you up to a kind of thing you ought to find
In the amount of lying that's called the " papers,"
Of constant tapping at your wooden wife's back door,
And all the rest you've gotten used to in the francs.
But there's a sort of proof, however it go wrong,
It reminds you of the articles of daily use;
And there's something you feel toward the end of doing right,
That starts you up against the race you're in.

'Twas all for the latest gossip up in the newspapers;
They had their fun; it gave them their own delight;
And Br'er Rabbit would sometimes entertain his peers
In a sort of a miniature WONDER WONDER as well;
He made a cup of good old Hazelthiah bucks
(That's Belgium for you--Aus French name for jack trumps).
And mixing up a shapful of his herbal juice
He told all the dregs of the drinker's lung
Could rise to the top of a short stack like that.
And calmly and patiently he watched to see how it went,
Until the hopper was sound and the woollriting reasonably strong.
When the "toot" came in the reward was but poor courtesy;
And I can't blame the lad all that he gin in it,
You've done well, old hat,
As you were formed to do.
My old Uncle's in the strait-'embreaking place,
The tailor's son, and he guesses
That you know what's his;

That matters not, as to this stream of life
I bow, who've learned to love what I am!
The long night through, I have been thinking
Of a speech by Faust alone--
Of that great day, when all their dreams of power
By his formula were writ down for men
To read, should their hearts but dare--
And how, when they but dared,
The great moon-reflecting words
Proclaimed them bastards of the world,
And of the living God they spoke,
In that earth-shaking phrase:
"This hill is not a mountain, but a grave!"

The night-black woods, and wilder still
The thrushes' soul-enraging waters--
The white-coated thunderful rocks--
The still-valley-beating blood--
All these I see and hear,
But off in a chill unbeautiful land,
Where no street lightbeams hint of coming hoofs,
Where night-rapt eyes catchfire of carrion eyes,

Where stumbling eyes have never read
Thegither "knoll,"
O'er which a mine of beauty glows--
Thegither styes,
O'er which a mine of God's rich graces flares--
The wild-rose Canyons,
That dim-gleaming glitter
As if their own dark goddess were applying suntans
For the good may-fruit of life's Perfect-Seed--
O, where thewild blood-clam goes running,
And there as many hearts as there are of them,
As there are of hearts that beat against the sun.

There as many hearts as there are of their
That this wild land leaves behind in the world of then--
And many more than that,
That in their sleep chop, chop, chop,
And on their lids a plening live,

The grief-bitter love and the sweet regret
And the fond love-denounced back-pelt--
Of those hearts I've seen so ill,
And in their sleep still--
I've counted sixty thousand chasms, and each of them
Or each of them a group of broken cerulean;

And the stray-braces, and the rushlight spanks,
And the spring-swols, and the sway-yards,
And the white-swats, and the rollings dusk;
And the gory old-scremizas, and the waxy caulsilcies
Of the hopes that would be o'ershadow;
For all blind events that past and future
Betoken, they scratch yet one spot of earth,
And underneath is known the Black Deee.

What say you to the rose, my Rose?
Say you that since her head, soiled and shrive,
Wept over her father's knees,
The poppies beneath her root,
Which both brave men threw down to her,
Have made her pang-ray
And her front-stone, too,
Of her grief upon her father's knees.

What say you to the brightest star, my Rose?
Say that it is more than light
To look through and see by how much all else
Is fathomlessly small in itself;
And, by the quality of its knowing,
How small all depth and all height are.

Alas, the heart-strings pulled by and by
The poppies, like blossom falling down
Upon the white limbs of an old man,
To his lean face in the dark there in the dew,
And his thin lips stretching weak and white
Lipp'd so wide to receive the scent,
Tossing it right hand from right into left,
As o'er his palate sweet wine does splash the pink,
Till the soul topples down like a rainbow.

But thy here, in my poor sparrow, where all are,
All years be blent, thy weightless body says,
"Alas, poor world-brained thing!
Ugh! the head's red sweet of all heart's blood-drippings!
Ugh! the peacock's feather-swept, empty blossom!"

What say I to the sparrow, poor thing here of head,
Which, because its heart's new dawn floats into sight,
Even in the close and leafy whirl of spring-time,
Doth for the while like a soft star-siracle,
With a speculative flight
Dancing through the sweetis sunny nothings of the meadows
Till it comes back to the flower-time and the eye,
And take they place of those young stars that were breaking?

His stately hair down from his shoulders, to deck,
The maiden led him where a cave was set
Within a rocky cliff, which there was none
But might conceal him from the morn till his
Mouth and limbs were warmed more and more. The wolf-boy
Showed him, and, when he had, no more delaying,
Dropped him, and sprang at him, seized, and tore
The matted hair, and dragged him in triumph out.
Nor was doubt of this less fiercely fought; for so
The spirit also fought; so that each blasted
Crablanch, single-handed, would sustain
Several purities.

And now the prince's
Finest hour of life was unaccomplished,
For three days he lived with that sweet living
Miss; then once again he rose, he felt himself
Awake, and marched, with the child, up the stairs.
The step-mother scolded, he merely smiled
At her bland speech, but had already
More strongly moved when, with mop in hand
He came, and, in a word, sent her to die
In the office of the Old Justice, where
She surely would be triply worse'd
Than on the Registry; so put her there,
In another seat, and O, what a place

And what a light! a window there was opening on
The right hand, and in it a single light
Golden-green, not but electrical, shone;
The seat of death was never more filled with light.
This light shone ever, never, full of seed
Of the deadly flame that soon burumes the heart
In those who wage with honest penant sin.
He close the door after, threw the light out,
And when he looked, the place was a field of flowers,
The very round abaxherding, the child there
Whom no prayers nor suppers took, and her face
All hale, and crowning with her cup, and she
Had need be drunk; there were none to meet her;
There were none to soothe her pain; thus would

She turned to drink, holding the child's hand
With those other nerves of love and chafing.
Then at the feast she told all to George,
His-and-her best friend, and to the Lord
Who had both Billy and the Baby.
So bright her eye and eye shadow too,
It made Melabel's eyes the same brown,
The brown of airs by Phoebus drawn
Which are the bane of poets; for they
Come close and leave more rare on the sight;
So did Orpheus' thunders hiss
At her soft speech, which did his fury shut
And melted into a mild and slow smile,

And yet 'twon shine alive, and redouble
Her beauty; he would lay a touch more deep,
But felt himself, and with his best self check
The overture Eurydice did bear
To their return, and his crosse him give
To a large woman with lordly look,
Whose beard with many a land had made
A smooth arch to the umbilicus white
That tun'd his collar ("O make me feel the pinch
That made the world see ince," said she),
But who, when men would talk of State affairs,
Had been her tales to hear, and now
Had taken in her good mother to observe
Her state within a transparent glass.
She had it seen with a great deal of glee
(For things in heaven may seem low to us
That don't have faith in them at forty),
That he would forget his private care,
And be angry (her thought) with him;
And therefore not between his grumbles and jokes
But quietly, and in sort comment:

Had made him feel the other was right;
And Nino saw the Lord Grazvioso
Had got a friend which him to call;
A man of his kind, with honour honouring,
With whom the greatest friendship was fain
To bind him. This Nino spake to all,
And thought only of the child alone.

The day when these good men were called to sit
At affairs at Tibur's place, where crowd
Had gathered, to hear them speak, was one
Where George and Dimier Johnx both were come
(Lamp and bellety breaker out of bed,
Ring at the ringing head, the cathedral bell
Sends out to every member' shack) to try
Their language to keep the peace as they conferred

able to ride through dark,
Spoke in that miracle of black,
And the darkness bent over Him,
With bowed head.

I love the dusk, the broad-flushed skies of November
with the tiny clouds
dressed in fleeces,
And the autumn-soft,
And the tints of winter and the golden,
The deep, the blue eyes of the white deer.

I love the breath of mild winter,
With its mixture of fear and rage,
The tender winter rosebuds,
And the white branches like a proud crest on a castle wall.

I love the wide, white light of early spring;
And I love the bold, red flowers of spring.
I love the red plows that are turning each day,
The tousled black hair of the forest,
The red foot that is lashing the dirt in the wind,
The red flame that is flaring from the forge,
The red, red scent of the pine-tar distilling;
I love the red mud of the black skulk of the otter,
And the red of the fire of the woodman's heap;
The red of the rooster's back in the warm straw-shop,
The red of the sky on the far-off snow,
The red of the wine-thumper's nose held high at the hatch,
And the red sun on the mountain top.

I love to hear the black-faced people crying,
And I love to hear the clear silver groaning of labor;
And I love the gleaming of the screw-holes spreading,
And the tawny dark eyes of the night cock rising;
And I love to hear the harpers holding up the darkly shining ladslippers,
And I love to feel the red lip of a bearskin blackgirl whispering love;
And I love to hear the long, soft, purty tones of the blackfoot,
With his stitched black shoulder-patch;
And I love the thrill of the night wind on my forehead,
And the sullen, sullen love-lorn cries of the eagled crowd;
And I love to see the gray-puckering spit of the tall jays bearing,
And I love the red-wet noses of the cursing cats.

I love the clanging of the great swords of the forest,
The screaming of battle-slash-confusion in the distance,
The rattle of the pansies in their whisp'ers,
The red-stained wyams that are peeled and shining
And the bright ruddy ofness of the dusk enemy—
But most, I love to hear the clear-tinkous note of the black trumpet,

Oh, but the night is descending,
All its tangled matted hair,
Over our futurity
In the end of this moment,
And its cold, black heart is yet
Drowning in the deeps of night.

And the enemy is rounding
From its high cheer of laughter;
And the joy of its children
To the windy silence
Will not wake this instant,
But its burned breath is stirring
In the deep heart of night.

Oh, let us fall upon our whip-like stress,
Oh, let us rend from our own good will
All the sadness of this presentment
Of an enemy that soon will be here,
All this tormented thoughtlessness
In this feverish presentcast.
For the day is soon most the same as the day;
The summer night goes down to the thistle-side;
There are fields to be gotten, and a few strokes,
And there is no more our home than yesterday;
And our whole history up to this moment,
Read out over a piece of blocking-matter
With not much to exhibit save
Some colours and the surname of our head.
So, take our pen, write our names, and be done with—
It will do us no harm to go and make ourselves scarce.

So the white devils pass us, as we pass,
And the dead ones creep us, as we pass,
And the dead ones lift their feeble eyes,
Or divert themselves with the things we love,
While their brethren with us, with the same best loves,
Await in line, and make our loves prevail.
But she, the she-bird, that this fierce gang
Blinds with her dim leafage, watches us,
Wags her crown of spikes to see much light,
And so bethinks herself what good devil will do
To a brute covered with black brain alone,
In whose glance she looks like the plain man's devil,
Wagging her two black wings like them of yore.

 no hot gaze upon her,
No cold reproof of her faring so;
No grey eyebrow, and no furrowed face,
My child.

Wearied of home,
The man returns,
And cool of hand, and loveliness fresh and clean,
Rise from the grave at every cottage door,
And wonder at.
The hearth fires his soul, and he
Shows the tall, brown plant at the plant's height;
Wonders in life from the grave, and life in death,
Rise from the ashes in death's wide green unknown.

LO, the grass is grey around the field,
The day is past, man says,
And dew drops bitter on the grass
And the sheen of the dell,
Brings sadness back, I think,
To many an old, unhappy,woman;
And tears will fall on widow's hair
And salt the bitter grain;
And the oaks, whose long, green, cloud-like leaf-sndrawers
In silence wait for little ones,
Will weep for the long, long joys past.
But spring-flowers come again,
Their pleasant voices pealning from all the trees,
Brief and rich, like those of yesterday.
I saw old fences, where now no fence
Affords an end to a long, long grief;
I walked along the hedgerows green,
And enjoyed each slow-creating force,
Ruddy and young and full of wisdom.
Now Vimes, in the parlor parrots say
I have the only bird, called Barbara,
Who will come and love me though she not
A nursery-teeeny six;
And she pecks my grey hair with her huge eyes,
Just like the well-known, famous sky-fish eyes.
There is an old, old, moss-coloured shawl,
Tied up in meshes, and around it go
Rippling twigs.
I found an ancient time when women sat
Fixing collars, whence blood did thunder enter,
When some went stark and stark and some went mad;
And the landlady's husband rode each way
To villages left no other land having
But those two hanging, one on either side.
It would have been a hellish thing to have seen,
Those hanging, though the penalty for crime,
Those two, between, while their children- wives stood by
Hound and man,
Ning, ning, ning, by their daughter's tears,
And man and hound,
Snarling, frothing at the time and crying.
But the knot in that old hedge-bow, red and green,
Now I can hardly bear to look at it;
And the big old picket fence, that I wonder crosses
Its legs, both dog and horse lying
At ease,
Eyes set upon the parson, sire and son
For their protection and their earthly sweets.
What, no sign of the mysterious bunny,
No old, old sign, no sign at all,
(I say what I think without doubting her,)
No sign, no sign at all,
No sign, no sign at all?

Then, the rain
And the sun, and the wind, and the shadow long,
Slant over the sultry English fields again,
Bringing a hastening, and a gladness to my thoughts,
Of the days of love, and all they keep in store,
And how they smile again.
I may die well, un- draped by a white gauze,
In the field again,
The two lying together,
My heart and heart, the pauper and the lord.

I wish I was in England now,
When Robin's coming, to see
The children of Heathcliff come,
With Moonley standing mid the throng,
Above a man and child,
To dance, I'm told, that swiftness,
Backed by an alder-chair,
Like the night-wind of Wales.

Peers of the court, by step or ball,
They came, they went, a firth-ball
Along the harbour-side,
Robin talking, calling Dante,
Calling horrible Doria ordina,
Making Abate some king of brass,
The naked man that bears the moon,
Making beautiful Naples nought
But blond Hol very rare,
Baring her bosom atte norone,
Making the school-house an Elysium
Of embroidered wallpaper,
A holy sanctuary, in whom could be heard
The sweet horse-boy speaking of the Grimoire,
Or the Abbess-singing the chanson:
Her, the imp of everything imp

Most amiss, one morn; but he, in fine,
Had given her all he had; and then
She let him pass; and one, as most to blame,
Remarked, he was her own number now!
And here--O sentence of Judgment e'en
More horrible than that of Light!  To wit:
Since first the galling tyger Bark of Night
Darting his bold orb gryphon-like,
Into the light his sidelong stepping meant
Ominous, had my Lady not turned back
Her light to him, and he believed not one
So imps of secrecy, deceit or guile,
By his informer, had been trusted to.
Light well knew the treacherous mind of Love,
That templed her own eyes by the eyes of Day;
And as slow his light-winged transgressions grew,
Slow was his step and slaverlessness of spectrum;
Nor lost he her faith, so wilful and so soon,
Till suddenly sheled into doubt and doubt.

She had been true; and they had fought: not lone;
Their day of wedlock she had won, against
The strong Predation which, without clamor or suit,
Seized on her cold like a devourer.
And yet, as hard as he found her to be,
That she who had been so fair in so long,
He would take all shame he meted her, for man,
Back from her; and thought it were all nobler fight
Than such a one, to have won the second mate
Of two tall pursuitors, heavy and stout;
And heavy though he were, yet he might so,
Drive her out to one side of the Balenestrill,
Whose coats and slops would cover her; and fit
His violent pace to her loose cope and shoe,
Which gave triple ease of motion and recovery.

I had almost deemed the wight was Merlin's child.
His words were good andwonderful, though I thought
How can a ninefold profession bail
With such decencies, and not even harm,
The gloriously named augur, lying low,
Sundering at peace in his old family home,
Scared by his wondrous ways, all suggesting rape
Since he first tugg'd his crown to Saul's time,
Who stitched a king's padlock legs with three knots.
And, though I treasured what but seven years befell,
When I of that wight scarce half a haul,
The pity of it made me sundered from mine eye,
To strike some more rise-ing impulse;--when lo,
A youth, the flower of augurs, with his back
Above the bench of a House of Commons.
If you heard his voice, and heard his news with mine,
What do you make, and where design's leading?
As they sought to fill a misprovisioned vacancy
(What thing shall the good nation take up?)
The post of Seamstress in a Phase,
On which they made their selection;
And, being agreed, it seemed a careless thing,
To select her, they of selectors:
A third screening might check material genes.
This Julian were to marry, these moth-like arms
From a third arm, and householder's property.
They gird at the seam, and arc the belt a hansil
To keep their interest in the seat a-blistering
'Neath the mental scenes they restaurant host
On a hot June-night; the town-meadowed fields
Of orange-blossom and unguent mileage;
The heath-rock's bush that is nearest to the solids:
And lastly the unseen two-tiered arrival:
With rosetoned no-novelty of inward doorway,
And post-ofmetre projecting outward from the door.

black birds in camouflage.

The rock is yellow and everything

poison and pock-marked stingray.
There is nothing to see, but everything is covered with,

undulation and hue.

Then the men came up the yellow rock

and all the way to the white rock:

a dog: shiny, blotched, ragged,

with an eye of dull and high pity.

And there was also a small dog
closely watching.

The whole of the rock was not only yellow,

but color-ghosts in the stone

of predatory thought

engraven and coming.
They came up the yellow rock

to full visibility:
beached whales,
spent, scaly, dying
whom the yellow rock was for the yellow rock.

The yellow rock was waiting

That the 49ers are showing

In games of leap-frogging and

Well, maybe 'twas, but it was

I could run, but I couldn't hide:

Four three- or four-five hundred

Throws a matchless overnights

And the men of the 49ers

Were like humming-bird children

In the thigh-deep bramble-bushes,

They were losing to such opponents

As could run no more than they could shit.

Then the old pro, my friend,

He was older, sack-slashing Texas,

He was pro-Marshall, pro-Mr. Apuleo

He was tossing around phrases

As if he were overnineteen,

And if he was over twenty-eight

He might have been the fieriest man

In all of pre-Civil

He was tossing around phrases

As if he were overnineteen,

And if he was over twenty-eight

He might have been the fieriest man

In all of pre-Civil
Wedding or twenty-eight was

But he didn't fuck up.

He sent a letter to the players,

He wrote an entire book

About the fucking up.

And if you're over nineteen you MUST

He lectured me from the printing

Technicians a half-century

He lectured me about manners

And if you're over nineteen you

Must keep your mouth shut
 and not have no disagreements

With anyone.

He lectured me from the printing

Technicians a half-century

As if he'd been a boy.

That's right, son.

If a seventeen-year-old male

Who's bigger than the rest

Be the one to call you out,

You might have

Some talk.

In the old NFL, if a player

Beat your wife and you died

On the court of public opinion,

You were fucked: you were fucked.

You were fucked if your wife

Was really bigger than you.

She was fucking bigger than you

So she needed a monkey

A thousand feet long to change her

From swelling up to larger than everything.

This is how I feel about you.

But that left undone, the event
And that part played in doubt,
We, if all is well, shall find.

But leave this busied ground,
And make your study
What's at hand here and there;
With two or three friends
Guide the ship by the oar,
And you may be pleasantly
Arrived at your first shelter.

So that first pleasure endures
Until you are everyone's friend;
So you'll find your privilege
Resemblance, in a nick of course.
But if at first you go wrong,
And in spite of wonted kindness fail

Don't forget, my friend, to say
The reason you do it.

Doomed or determined otherwise?
Or his prophets mad? or both:
Are they both doomed to die

And in sepulchres to dwell,

Struck out from a topisch wall
And tomb-swept to make a boat-and-rail,
And thence forever remained?
When this you learn, pray him
That he fight and not endure.

By what word,
Or what idea,
Is the alien any good?
By what same self-same word
That wakes up blood the first thing in the dust,
As the same idea or the same fear?
For, just as straws,
Or worms,
Or birds,
If shot through the bird's nest are,
Or gods to men comming (not like these),
So a wise man may be killed,
And no sign of God to any man.
If he's so far-gone,
Or godhead, or extraterrestrial,
'Twill make you believe none's exactly good;
And the less of god, when he's worse,
So may a man's devil produce.

To say that there has been an outburst of raids
On the neighbouring villages mainly by the Folk,
And the sound of women carrying off the men
From the waters of the Horse, would all seem highly improbable,
Except for previous exhibitions of farm implements
In the garden or woodland neighbouring; and thus it appears
That the Folk, after fulfilling their stomachs' needs,
Leave the farms to hunt together stopping seldom
To rest the heavy work of the day, and often passing
In a sultry weather with few people present
To see the sport, the coach and four might pass in silence.

The Sousa, a light proper to move on,
A narrow spot, whose hilly profile, breaking
Above the valley, gives present protection
To that side only, cannot be called a fault:
It is likely that whosoever made advance
To ride upon it, had perished utterly.

On the road from Elster Sousa Mountain To the North Chiltern,
The Car of St. Larther had a seat for me,
But I never slept in it; and having passed
The Crawford on its ridge, the part that shook
Was still in grief and black as in a grave.
And this, indeed, the Crossiem of Wuthering is
Which damns the fields to absterable clay.

The Crow's-in-air, for many a year, I guess,
And now, when it has been a weary guess,
The Iron-Apple has stirred it to a jolt,
And swore a dozen legends against it; so
It shall not lack, with other ordinary,
In that regimental regiment of legends,
Led by that Lady with the Stroke of Butterflies.

Nor man nor beast can stand against that stubborn streak,
The bull, the bullock or the trainer's dog;
The mist and bluster have nothing to do
With the iron-color of the autumn rose;
And, what might say, the painter had not even seen
That snowy blaze of Victory, so exalted,
And narrowly missed, through Meaker's pierced and shattered ridge.

It is pleasant to return through Eagle Honrick
To Windermere, where the little stream mumbles
To the quarry through the woods of Lydcott:
The cooinglings, the woodpecker, the cooeing vioar,
The wren, the rotund robin, the grouse whist,
The loon, the owlet, and the chaff cried over,
Are present to justify the moaning liner:
The bird, the leaf, the floweret, and the pen,--
There's my vetoed bill of particulars.

In Windermere, we are asked to trust;

======================================== SAMPLE 332 ========================================
Lo, a foe, whose form doth as in a book disclose
A hoard in gold hidden from the sight.
Who can this be? the hidden thing of all
Who can the rest?

This is he whose crimes here we prepare
Refresh the spirit with law and truth:
The world grows sick of empty scorn,
And a high faith o'er stolen joy we feel:
With eager spirit we behold him rise
That man's contempt and judgment to efface,
And he is me, who have humbled now
The soul with presumptuous pride.

Where is the whole of pride in what
Law is turned by the writer's self,
Who may not see how the phantom rhyme
Gleams on the fancy like a hen's egg.
When will it end? when will it leave the story?
He can, he dare? he will.

A cloud rose over the scene. A mad pursuit.
"T-m" waited, ignorant, knowing not where he was,
Whirled by the speed of the music of sound,
He felt the wind's speed, and the reason too,
Which is the reason of the wind.
There is the skin of my horse's skin.

And when you stand at a statue's feet
It is a whiteness, it is a height,
Beyond to whatever is unaccented,
Unkept, untopognized, unknown,
Which is the part of a noun and a noun.
I knew, and my sight can do no more,

There is no wind to play with: it stands,
As if it had always to be.
"I never did anything but knew;
I was never on a horse. My mother
Never told me the stories you might tell.
She thought I might have a relative.
She thought. She never questioned whether

This, then, is what I've made of all I got,
And all I want to know."

She was out of her wits. Her ex-lover was dazed
And sulking beside her; but he seemed to hear
Her calling his name. She rounded on him,
And as he stood there wavering, shaking the bow
He had so often rounded with.
"Dare you," she asked in her most pathetic
Emphasis and desperation.

"Me? No. But I loved her. She died to me."
He took the hand, and stood beside her as before.
He had not heard the arrows go.
A hush fell over the land.

"She's dead." It seemed to come from the sky.
"She's dead. I grieve for you. She was my friend.
And you?" He lay a moment at the edge
Of a dingy lawn, and then he reached his feet,
And waved the hand, and it was once again
Sponge-armed with flowers.

He was a hideously giddy dressing-up
For a film of adventure with nonsense super,
Berries and slime and the lobster tail of squeaking rubber.
A peak and streamer for the echo of a yappy blackbird,
And he wore a peak and streamer of familiar blue
To the opera of his mother, scolding him
In the outside world.

He was a giddy blue for his own fists and lies
And tocks of smoke perchance to keep bluer and whiter,
A blue that kept getting thinner and thinner,
A blue that went through the streets of the town
Like smoke across the face of the ravine,
And he wore the blue in the place of his wife,
Who searched and pleaded and was clawed to death,
And then he wore the blue at last
Before he slumped,

So the blue went through the town
And left him there where he lay,
Holding his breath against the past,
The blue through the city came and went,
Blue as perfume or blue lichens blowing in waters
For their powers to follow, blue as the smoke of burned gold,
Blue with fear or blue with despair or blue with neither,
One that would not die,
For the sight of its very self was a relief,
Like the farwind back of a leafless tree,
Or the hinge of the river in a fortress
Opening out far through gentle waters.

The blue is all about him there
In this juncture,
Trapped and fleeing like the all-flying hawk
Throughout the regions of night,
Trapped and instrumented as the signalist
For faintest flicker of metallic threads,
Or the all-aware engine trailing a darkness starry.
And here the dark wind wends its way
Through the dress of the frame,
And this is all his home

Which in life were servants of the spirit. '

'Ay, as the beauteous point of beauty's in the mind,
It falls on spirit's and on body's is the sway.
And soul, being charged up, a clear flame will send
Full to the depths of hell, and out of the mind
Takes wing at last where soul left left wants.'

And then the dead sea-meramonious changed its dress
And had all teeth out and nails out, and pegs on
All over as the fishes do in the seas
In order that its brother-spirits, when they come,
May find their body pierced by all the eyes.

In the face of this people, for they resemble
Those who have been exterminated forever
The Milky Way, and in the head a monstrous lump
Comes out and grows, and when the sunlight falls,
Cracks in two, and the thing grows blind and void.

I do not love water, I only come here
For my sales, my sales, my sales.... It is true
That those who do not love you above all
Can find in silence a way to pay you no mind,
And when one walks through water, one finds a lump.
Nay, it is this monster that I love so,
This monster with the head of man, of rat,
This monster, killed by water.... This is the same:
Water: and then, then, comes the water.

O Love in short, O stupid Love!

By the fact of mean hair and a misspelled location,
By the fact of walking about with a first-half that is not Bosnia,
By the fact of yielding yourself to a first-half that is not Bosnia,

"Even the Sun Going Down", by Roy Horton [Love, Realistic & Complicated, Relationships, Nature, Stars,  Planets,  Heavens]
The old woman in the old barn swallowed her tongue
and went outside to play that ugly old woman.
She sat down by the open door and gazed up
into the sky.
Only the empty dark and a bird were there
not even a twinkle in the sky.
The red leaves of the barn were withering
and dead birds sat on their wings not even
a twinkle in all of them.
The old woman walked on and off along the path,
the shadow of her face against the snow
was as far as she was going and she was
already sad.
She walked into the barn to put her arms
around a neck all of her son's own,
and when she rubbed the thick end of it
against his lip the cruelest feeling
in the world was what she thought but never was.
Not the bird but the old woman's thought
was the unforgiving heat and the cold.
Not even the beautiful shadow of her
body on yours, not even
the heat off the fire and the strike
of a crown of stars dying together
was as bad as that.

"The River", by Francis Osborne Pious
How strange is the thing, or out there,
And terrible and far, and how above us,
Yet here in the houses and the streets;
Where cats and dogs have built a house
Round for them a few piles of sand,
And there in the river-caves
They hide from our fear and our doubt
But think they are far up above
And their snakes and their black demons
They are throned above the city,
And if we call they evilly call,
Or top-heavy it clicks like a switch,
And they scream with their monstrous voices
Or drag their legs in the sand,
And clench their teeth and splash round the lake
With strange, lame words that do not serve,
Or add: "If, thou, Herry, Herry, Hryry!
Thither I fly and thence not I;
Thither I fly and hence I never went.
But that you thus may know I never went
I swam in the ocean at Easter-time."

"After the Fish", by William Butler Yeats [Love, Break-ups & Vexed Love, Heartache & Loss, Unrequited Love, Relationships, Men & Women]
For one of us there was a fish that touched us,
And one of us was mad upon the tippest beach,
And the night sent a dark direct to break us.
But none of us was dead, and none of us
Had lost love a whit.  And now there is a fish,
And now one of us is mad, and then not.
The wolf is dead of his bitch,
And one of us is mad upon the beach,
And there was the black unfair woman
Who now is slightly dead,
And she is well enough to come and call
With not unfeeling toe, "TJ, over"
And "Cock-ey, forward," and "What is your opinion?"
I was not in the supine to shreds
Of black-looking ruin,
And love was not black to me then
But blacker than was platonic.
What happened then? - Was I in the horror?
I was not in the appearance
Of mad, black ruin.
But blackness was and muted ruin.
What tangled webs of destiny
Ailed soul and soul regards?
O, blackness of the look
Of that one whom we regret, -
And black of maddest ruin, -
And black of the tangle!  Yet not all!
There was a time when maddest ruin
Was tinged light; and we knew not how
Our maddest ruin might fair seem
At last, settled, resolved.  We only know
That maddest ruin moves not alone from blind
Blank shape and blind prospect.
The mind also grows and dark;
And wild mind ruin shapes to ruin.
Our mind was not black to see
The maddest ruin move.

Though I doubt him in his other arts,
Still that none the less can withstand his darts.
Nor is that evil that a menial slave
Like me dares to scrawl such wild alacrity
O'er a tale of Gulliman the proud,
Merely to gain by my short stay some reward
Such as might whereof I care to ask an ear
Though not my own, yet what his country's news to show.
'Tis evil for the Lord to lay forth
His wrath in such a menace bold,
Who dares that none can stop his course without
Some dreadful vengeance take in that kind heat.
There's need for all, and I will get me one,
Whate'er the cost may be, at once and now!
Or thou, great Master, grant, with one cry
Thou hast wrathivved all thy savage race,
And also me, too far afield my search to make:
I have found nought in thee to anger live,
And had I power my wrath with thee to lash,
None more than thee with doom quite ready came.
So say'st thou, and that to change in thy stop,
Which art more heavy at this moment lies,
Thou must firstly by this right arm underpen
For thyself that rage of thy heart  gaze.

Turn both his feet; for such a goodly time,
He had just quitted Thebes, where he got
From jocund sleep lulled thereby a torment;
Shook so his long sea-rolled horn and all
At once put it at terrible sore,
And all his menial thoroughfare was movd
Intricate workhouse to erect;
And gna right good-degre his soyle was stor'd,
And in it nothing but damn'd wretch should geean.

Who dares be born unto her son's error,
Where she by lot might shee beware very well,
A mighty mischeife can in haste be here.
So says he in his anger, t' affrighted one,
Whose hair with such an one ungraced keeps close,
That in arm's succour is and in his eenne* craft*,

And likewise honourd with a sable reel

Which might the ioyster sooth furn "Christ Slainte"
Bedeirly through all his armesh compas
With that his tunick pat below him doth hooan,

And in them shall this offend
That in his head 'tis hard to sleight be shedde
And in his eare blench 'tween his hooers het,
And with his toes turned up perch'd like a pike.

And with his nails he ties very long

Into great eruption, throwing out of his behooe,
And in the best hee's full dispos'd to beare,

Here you see the dull light play
And the silver water ripple by,
Where a lone canoe rides the murmurous bay.

No laughter, no boast of verse,
No boast of arm, no martial ode,
But the gay shore line's jubilee
When the day's forest's lanes unblest
Leave time's flower-crowned kings forlorn;
And the saw's gnarled trunk again
Tossed to the waves and dashed o'er,
Where the light craft sails not now.

Once, long ago,
In the land where north and south extend,
A highway for the chariot ran
Beginning from the golden starts
Of the snow-white sea and the yellow land,
Winding through the forest's shadowy hard,
In the path of darkness; so that the driver
Might follow in crashing waves the tow
That rose and fell beneath his wheels.
Now, no longer sign-less of the sun,
The soil is turned, and season flows
Blown out to endless length and flight
Since the black boots of the chariot stay
The onward march of the life they tread;
And the tractor, at whose ugliest start
She stands and looks with little lust
Of admiration as his thing you guide,
Has learned to cast a part in the swerves
That his chariot swerves to and from.
But the farmer, intent to earn
The mockery of the picked crowd,
Scornfully alters the prune of his bark,
The hedge of his clock left as bare
As the night, and the fold untenanted
Of the true movement of his broad's stretch
And, to the wonderment and the scoff
Of the birds that flock to and from,
Heaves up and up to the topmost
Casqueless, and by no wind but that whirl
Of his own ocean-maddening tide.
And he cries, "She lives,
The cold, triumphant teacher lives,
And I that shall follow ere long!
May I ascend and look at her, as she lives
Up in sunshine watching me wander by her--
Do I live? Do I live?
No? Then I die!
No wind to tell my lab'ring and my soul to thee!
Look up at her, and read over her:
See how the air goes pouring under that story
Of the lake before the crag and tree,
And the water tight and tight between them!
Winter is come!
See, brook after brook
Pours down to the sea!
Look at the wings of the breaking mist,
At wayward mist that spicy quickens
As it tightens over the floor!
Hear the blast at the door withdraw!
The winter's clutched and sealed;
And the eaters are full!
Hear the frost's beat down in halls!
Hear the sturdy rock be rocked in rail,
As the first reel round to the ground!
It's bare and lawless in the quiet,
As a brook with a barren stone,
Encroacher by woodcut and strong.
Yet the say of the stones by the rock
In whispers above the meteor streams
And the small movement of the river,
As the minnow's eddy whirls to the main,
As the fortune of the shaker flashes,
And draws it to the bottom broad and vast,
With the rest of its fiery load.
So the winter's wrath at the roof does cling
And make the boards, heavy and sapless,
Tackle like a life-call of a mother's.
So the ice, beyond all turn in the pane,
Chafes for a space the sheeted sheet to tongue,
And, as the breath that turns it to stone
It comes and it goes, a fact if you watch,
Core recovered five days after and still
It cleaves to.
So it, when the snowflakes heap'd in the wind
Rear on their bulged amplitudes on high
Sank down by likeness to her image, white,
And her face said "Do not move."

And the face that said "Stop,"
Slew one smooth swoop of its pallor,
And the glinder took note and stepped aside,
The steps or floor apart to descend.
But the face that said "Stop,"
Peroxide'd sharp and white as a pearl,
Painted the same vivid hues and azure,
As a child of the prime
Prisen'd a painting on the wall,
And who starts last again.

Haste, sir; there, England's witch-wind blows

Qur'an) before the life.
"It is no good!" 'Vive le Jour' was the cry,
"You're not fit to eat bread, you're not fit to drink water,
You're not fit to sleep in a room alone,
It's no good having a little natural beauty,
Or a string of white, or three black eyes,
Or a generous chest, if you can't get a stone in your pocket;

You can't live with people to suit them,
If the hole in your leg makes you walk with a swinging weight,
Or your back pain makes you restless,
Or your frowsy breath makes you pale,
Or you lack one shoe, or two, or three,
Or you run behind a clogg while driving a cow;
The cinch of the tight-shank corks and snaps
And flies with a sound like a popped bicep.

A fast bird could not live with such swells,
And slow birds could not do it;
A flacer can.
The mite's requirements are quite shocking,
When he wakes each morn with a crawling shock,
And he feels so much in the milk and the dew,
And he's always so chubby and crumbly at meals.

He has a dreadful name for a hop,
And cannot fly to the safest sunny place;
He cannot cross a road or walking pace,
But on cricket-fields, and in walks, and in rows,
He'll creep with a gimlet-like flicker over the feet,
And he'll lie in the grass, slow but trotting.

The flicker's quaint, and clumsy, and slow,
And none knows what the devil he's meant to be;
He jumps, just like a baby, at everything;
He builds, and begins again to wreck;
He has no art, but foot-walks like a mouse,
And bites with a desperate hard-drawn jaw.

But he's really out of the way, and his very love
To the well-aimed bullet, his eyes and ears,
When his parched lips and chapped lips each thousand holes fill,
May sell for high or sell for low, as the trader,
May the seller be bold or he sell for sweet.

I can't describe the flicker that flies over the sky,
And he comes running over all by his self:
He comes, with the ground all behind him, and then,
He comes, and he hops--a crazy, baysome creature,
With a shriek or a squeak in his voice as he goes,
So that you'd know him by a voice, or a nickname if he had one,
With his tails all over him, and
Shirts that are green, with the short ears and the tail
Of a cat, and with pierced muzzles and pointed,
And with short dactylisms, and with a little muteness.

And then there is this dandy long a spring,
With the best of it, with the pride of a hop,
As leaping as he ever did in the tree;
And his eyes are flying, and his little dachshill
Spies a farcical view of the court, and he
Would deceive you by saying "I come to claim
Your piece of walk, pr'ythee, in the street,
Where the Friendly's House, as you can well guess,
Comes soaring, soaring, as egemen.  Now you see me,
If you look well, I'm Mr. T. Jones, and left-handed."

I was left-handed, you see, Miss, I'm so-
Or so I'm told; well, that doesn't make much
Of the angle of my fingers, if you think
The whole thing with just tax and duty; see,
I'm right handed, and my friend, Miss, is right-
To-hand like a chappie mill, and we pass him, you know,
And mine's a fine arrangement, hers is a late one.

Well, it's all fun, and we should be friends, and friends
At my left and my right, and "friends within reason;"
And we'd be eating or drinking, and we'd make
Many a semi-arcade show, and dance,
And joke, and joke, joke, joke; and you know what?
We'd dance, and daffadilly dances are queer;
We should walk farce, the pedals of daffodils, and
Singing in the woods, and the chocolate-bottle squares.

Down to the goose that never hat
Her shell in the marshes, thro' a fissure
In the chalk that never quivered before:.

Lakes that have a majority of their

And over them and o'er, and over,
With unbelievable largeness,
The ocean going on from hill to hill:
Over all this wonderful station,
With a sudden spring,

Here's a place where two rhymeful lines
Come round a rhyming commonal;
Where dreamer sits with eye benign,
That all the delights of a
Place should dispense bitterer wine.
Here's a place where all seems blest
Because all things are blessed in turn;
A cradle, there, and a graveyard
Spread with many an ANGELUHLE fronting
Together in a BENCHMARK, together.

Out of the first we shall take a peak
Of the place called "Bethlehem,"
And the hill of Sorrow, and the place
Where HE who had not yet come, ABATED
The bow of Canaan stretched without bound,
As if, for pity, He battered
The rocks under our feet as we paced
The wild, Western ridge,
That, stretched without bound, a weal-shouting FLEW.

And it, all enthralled by a shamrock,
And haunted by a single snail,
A place where God might largely feel,
With enough and various things
To suggest His very heart, a longing
For something whensering His to-be-loved double-faced waiting
Beneath a western eve,
Lord's past the sixth, with face towards Arabia!

It might have been, and in a few years,
In our open bedrooms by a fire
One day might see us both together,
Thoughtful and quiet, in a goodly heap,
As together, in a goodly heap,
We slept in the same room when we came
After that long and fearful troping
Out of Nazareth, and up in Heaven.

We know not why the Sea Gull in Heaven
Has changed his faced yet, and ceases to face
The planet sun, now when he wakens.
But perhaps, like those imperial seals
That keep their wisdom in the same box
Which once hid King Apollo's speech,
He finds it time while strangely preserved,
As waters forth from spring of nectar slaked,
To evolve and find a secret use,
Hence of no use at all, really,
In a world of yea and nayings but ONE.

The white rose fades; and love's fair tree withers,
And from the summer, as those dim stars decline,
Faint Nessuna dies, Famine's cleansing candle burnt;
Through many a night the Wind-Hawk wails her slayer;
But here, if thus, the cold had frozen desire,
And motion lost, they only woke again
To hear each other and to look on each.

The lion's guards, the cubs' play, were gone,
The moccasin stood at bay,
The white foot swept the dusty track,
The boats were ashore,
Eve white, puce, squash, primulina wine;
But there came no buzzing ages homeward,
No droning thrones of kings,
No lamps athwart the bridge's clouded wing;
But still
======================================== SAMPLE 339 ========================================

To the row of vessels, the green deep,
And the earth that is the frame of the world;
And now, for the first time, he seemed
To view a fitting scene for God's own temple.
The waters rose and fell;
He saw them as a God might see them,
As incarnate power, a God to be.
They girt the world as a Lord had ruled
His creatures that were witnesses of him;
They crowded in the great river's bed,
And gathered all the islands of earth.

There were two conferences first,
Before these shrines, of which the common sky
Bears witness, they had both for their part
Fresency of glory in their earthly court;
And secondly, with like reverence of love,
To the Christ Birth, as to a blessed Bed,
Whose sheets were new, and going purplely
With water till they go a bit past
That they taint not, but are radiant all.

One, that was immediate on the spot,
Had with his brother one hour after Sunday;
Two, which were apart had leisure to dwell
And muse, but not compose, on those very texts
Which make the Christian stiff to walk forever;
Three, which were last and one of the seamen,
Made up the sacred compound as perfectly
As any newly thrown up by a genius
After a ten-year survey of sea,
And, all the seals of time or brass between,
Kept up and guarded all night long beside
The still venting water in readiness
To burst for feast on England's flesh when she
Must do the will of Jehovah's angel.

And now, the hour that might be called the last,
At last is come and found a spot at war.
With England now; 'twas fought below
The walls of Paris, in the ends of swamp,
Where the waters of the Po, guided here
By a motion taught in righteousness, went round
To punish France for two hypocritical nakes
Which she had not invited, and did not dispatch,
But which defied the authority
Of her reigning Monarch, and of Caesar
Who was his heir, Father of his country, to shake.
With all that blood the flood passed over,
Which would have swept away all nations there,
Before it would be convinced that she
Was hostile to all other nations, herself
Except a little space in possession.

Now, I believe that I have explained
The more, or the less, the grand cause,
For which we met.
The question is not of the deed done
By us all; it is of that truth we gainsought.
I believe that we were proved, or I
Had proven it, if I could discover
The fact that of a few days' power
In our defence -- except that time
Has been spared us much more -- we had been screwed.

That night I was an unnamed ghost,
With no more to do than turn and vanish
Of dull everyday rumour, which
Takes the form of fiction, then is destiny.
What is it guts a nation's might
To let a byline be as much as a term to
Rolling tragedy the main-bill length?
I got no more out of "The Treacherous Chance"
Than a bag full of sand and a spear to stick in.

There was something vague about the ship
That drew these men into its arms.
When some murmured, "I think we ought to get
The yachts here for their Racingurations,"
I would say to them, "You're out, boy!
Go drink Pabst out into the sea!"

And men would ask me, "Is there no light?
Is this thing ever crewed from armewe are
It's so mad in both these pals?
Will the saluting horns please slash the shadow,
And if so, when will we do the same?"
But by 1896 when it got to port
My conscience went up a hand-mill
That had well reloaded already.

I had a friend, who did not lack
Proficiency in Greek,
And he stood for many years could not
Understand a single word
Man said into speech without an end.
So mad the press clung to his shame,
And mangled him with speeches,
That by the civilized world's praise
They finally got him soft.

He salivated and panted
(It was harder than thirsting)
And watched in idle suspicion
A charwoman's negligance
As the coffing and the stamp and the paper
Were entrusted to her care.

I learned from a friend at Wapping
(As it transpired my father owned
A certificate of marksmanship
For a rifle) that
======================================== SAMPLE 340 ========================================
 listed here are varied lights.
These are three one-light candles.
At night my bedside
A friend would ask me,
"How is your health?
Tell me about your pregnancy."
This is what I would say to him.
This is my life.
At night I am
I, with my life, at rest.
I am the water
Who asks no mate.

As sure as hemmed crocuses or as poker I could meet her,
Sure, and as bound to keep time with her wherever she go;
But to call her thief, would be in much the same case
that is had for shoving Neptune in Roman seas.

A girl is not fit, and criminal, to be seen in a pageant called "The States";
She would, by common admission, more commonly be seen in;
A series of lectures, or a tour, or a condemnation in "The playhouse stinks,"
In fact no one should see her but her Rooker, or her Dom.

A casket or box of keys, and every one blunt;
A hat of sable, or better, if that will let her, not to have one particle
Of her hair fine, one single event if chance to get;
An eye free of luster, goit, and its abbot pike,
None of these excuses for her I seek, or she should me;
The fault I lay alone with all publike loveliness.

And if I should fail, with a flourish which will surely fail,
My life and tongue to banker petteth better than a pap remained;
If pellid, bankrupt, mean to call her "blooms" (nothing, reckon it man,
Shall rob her glory of the taint of higher taste;
I desire a reasonable exhibit of strong traits,
Such as she sees or feels to have caught from bad about;
As for dress, I think the last insult would set her up.

What she has heard from me, and what I have put into her tongue
Owes equally credence to her celestial descent
And her base elements beneath.
Ne'er will the soil the earth wipe off, but such trick's a patent
Of the common man, that if you've a kind heart,
You'll trust to its public race.

That said, I to her will incline
More to trust, than any public letter, than the eight
Thousand most puissant maidens;
Nay, I will have this pretender's subtle wile
Withholding all good faith in her, by a mere look;
That good look will carry a hell fire
Rather than that broad shame of every day wrong.

When her soft blush wakes the loud joy
Which she suspects me; that she should mistake me in
The happy time which I disclose to her;
For still more joyous, and hurlineer,
I hope than being my doom,
I hope than dying in gladiators' hands.

Let me unbend, let me relent
Even to the sin that she knows not ill;
Love without pretense, or dissimulation,
Will fit me for the last agony.
I should have matter, had I more or less,
To weep

Many, as I thought,

I do not now recall

I know that to-day

It is right to be happy.      (papa is

In that happy land,

Where they sing at

the shrill of trump,

And of God, the God

who at

this hour is thrust

forth from the

gracileth of Christ--

my poet-lord,

The truest one

he shall speak

of you!

I cast you, I

O prophet, out of

vain regard, into

the gross world,

Where the untrue

in crowd

with truth,

they shall shred

Your word,

true shepherd,

and

I shall never

in heaven

sate,

again.

(Here, to tickle

his time,

I have

written a few

recent poems

which shall

Of womankind,

I do not ask

reward,

but rather

entertainment.

I have

written a

good while

without

a woman


to gaze

upon.

Behold, behold!

I, who have

excluded

the senses

of pleasure,

and in which

I have

but myself

an object

that doth

present itself

whatever loose

attachment

I may

or have.

But womankind

contains, O my sweet friend,

the parts

of me,

and I containing

the other parts,

So that I but keep

your spirit

and your self

within me.

But, again, while I

am now tasting

again

my strength,

I have my

weekly there

and my time

for my own;

and neither day

nor year

is fixed,

nor time

to me.

No, mine

is not a nervous

hysteria;

I have simply

chosen a day

I love and

let it pass.

It may be the

crime, indeed,

to be so busy

I am free from

gratification.

I have no

longer

the-world-

Because I love

you, who

deserves it

for self-

patience.

I love my

I hate the

Sappho speaks in a fragmentary
Dantiace. She is said to have inscribed to
the intimate goddess a chain of verses
too exquisite for any sort of
debating amongst other than words alone: Iuelshe
pleasure she awaitedsuspended the expected friendly
level-headedness, and went beyond
Any form or display of that sensuous
Freed Spiritwoman; the friend
Natalisa gave her the beloved face
Elysium made her to feel and
endured estrangement from her
Fabled heart and the outraged sense
Of purpose never to be redeemed by
gratitude and she begged her
To turn her bitter gift back to
Joyous Formenable.

"From Lyrics of Goneen: 2", by Paul Muldoon [Nature, Seas,  Rivers,  & Streams]
Baffled by the exquisite and silent
Susana, who would not sing
For all the jewelled hair she owned; and
Disheartened thereby by her lonely singing
======================================== SAMPLE 342 ========================================
O how sweet was her voice and hie sight!
To me for round about

Where ere a tree was at its best
Her slender, slender form was seen.
A better than the grace
Of any poet seemed
As her eyes scanned the crowd,
And her heart relented
To the poet-hand
That had made her.

A slender yet very fair
And warm eyes there were,
That seem'd half joy, half ruth,
When they meet'd with some romantic date.
Her laugh, her speech
Were sweeter than the sound of nest,
Though but the trace
Whence it led was anything but sweet.

Her hair was silver white,
Thigh-high, and very fair,
On which the wind and sun
Had left some rainbow print.
But when her hair was white,
And shining, as she went
The wind and sun between,
It seemed to me a wild waste
On ocean, and all sky
But gold, leave it a wreck.

O then how bright, how fair
From her fair white cheek
I turned all day to see
The flower incline, the light,
The long, white, silver arrow
Of moonlight, falling, descending,
Or, cleaving as a sea-green fish
Four quivered parallel silver barbs
Up from her tresses.
Or, when the light,
Full in my face,
Is lent to me by her
Up, high rise the flowret,
The rain has left the snow
White the air, and smooths
The snow-man's face.

Yet there's one
Of love and me
To be with me
In all time,
So sweet one looks,
Her looks,
A child might hold for me.
Her look's
Mad amorous, and her voice's
Focused to one spot
She gives the wind for wing
And says what means what thing.
And all her body's grace
For love and me.
She laughs, she cries, she talks,
She pleads, asks, threatens,

O she says,
Her eyes are both blue,
She has the air
Of swift-footed birds,
And she has the speak
Of beasts of prey,
And she has the tread
Of mortals, half
That pace with men,
And half as fierce,
And she walks right luckless
All by her lonesomeself
To my woman's woe.

O I say, she tells me,
With eyes like tears
That have our love put out,
How much of God, be kind,
For our bothre's sake
Give them light and breath,
And let me, now, see far
To any heart in ye.
And be their hearts a relong
That for no thurst or good
Mine may lose,
Yea, let mine own heart's eye see
Of all sight, to ye-than.

With more than shadow,
With more than shame,
I have this forail
Born of some sin that stealth
Heard me from under ground,
Where I found pores
"A goodly size"
That my love might find me.
And how I labored,
Yet I woulda, should she find
Her way unto me,
And the thorn I thorn,
But to her succeed,
And from my hand take fast
And of my heart take keep,

I hope to God the gate is nigh,
That with his daylight well I've stemmed,
And my heart's weary enough.
There is too much of heave and sigh
There is too much penance to do,
Yet how the quicker I accomplish
All my life-blood does enable
In me fairly to fore-take
What duty has and what obedience bears.
But it's a cable,
And so to speak,
It's a fire of hope,
It's a water-cart,
And a wonder-worth
Of men do debate
If I God, do walk or ride.
I hope to God I have my will,
And my way have nailed it down.

I hope to God,
That the gate's open year 'and wide,
And the keeper, I have hope attested,
May see that I enter in.
That I need never turn back,
That the would and have all in his command,
And if I may defy him to spit,
I'll be here where I can rejoice and sing,
For the ransomed have never known any other.

I have lost all, but thou hast none to lose;
Who is the sinner? whom will I offend?
I grudge not lost, but unbalanced balances,
And points of light out

"O DILEMAIAN LANE", by Alfred Lazarus [Living, Death, Disappointment & Failure, Love, First Love, Classic Love, Heartache & Loss, Relationships, Arts & Sciences, Poetry & Poets]
So when death comes where today,
Has seen me walk alone
through the uneven streets
where heaps sand and concrete instead
of marble and heroes,
not even close to where I lived
in my culversation
with the Duke I was almost glad
to leave the world, for they would
speak no poetry
and almost glad to leave it,
so.

XII world ships in less
surmounting manner
than the short story.

In the long days before comfort
comparison, life seemed good.
And how should I know?
I only knew my friends
to be my colleagues.

Even when dark fancies seen
above, they were my friends.

And I died and could hear
the sand drifting behind them
toward the soft-packed buildings,
my funeral home, the gray stone heap,
the West - and then.

I died blind like all poets
blind and full of quotations,
touched by the world's mourning.

But what could I learn from a doctor?
Could sound track, only flesh,
could hardly bring a poetry
could hardly call itself "poetry."

Only look at the marble of my lungs.

And then I saw the cigarette
yellow in the hands of the young girl
walking with her mother who told me
of the beauty of their dead friend
and I saw the damaged Ford
Access Recreation space
where I had suffered a relapse,
Blank, Indiana, home of the Quakers.

A shadow of me moved while I
heard the hospital orchestra
begin to howl like birds from the United
Music Groups of the Great Aims.

The lights from the pool
atoning for the dead light
corraled each distance away
where I had put my face
and I knew the roses of second sight
were not mine.

And then there was me
who had no name in heaven
but knew itself loving
and hating and being loved
by every man and woman person
in the earth.

How to explain?

Is there a language
where I but chimed
with a guitar and sanded
with a sieve voice
or stuttered with an acoustic
keytar because I played it
so well

among the rows of raised
violins because I was Hemingway,
because I was the drinking party
or the duelist because I was
Hemingway?

In the squares and circles
of a square life
I too wandered and wheeled
with a Fordish heavine
in the mists of the barroom
because I was Ford Stenna!

Ford sells cars!
And I walked into a Panic
when one pursued me
through the swirling vino crescendos
of a factory's sudden shriek
and death machines' beep beep
of the mill and mint and dizzying
screaming culludient dictabros.

What would a Fordish sibilant
and gulped Ford stare inflame
in you? Because
I saw you howling,
dragging yourself back from escape bids,
I saw you howling,
found my tongue wrapped around
a Fordish flagon but flouted
and slipped out of the lexicon of Ford
because I was Hemingway.

Ford sells cars!
But what does Ford buy with?
A Scarred-strewn desert of escaped souls
of the soul's suffocation
where each Fordish phantom
arrives from its vapor-developed
reckoning of guilt
with unchanged " s " guilt
" guilt " guilt " guilt
with Fordish fal dura
guilt.

And you found me howling
the second time
and heard me murmur like a dog
after I escaped with your life.
I have no money for your booze.
Give me your best dance step.
I bought you howling.

Ford sells cars!
And I bought you!
And, to be sure, have ruined
and made murder of many homosexuals.

"Gleb Gabor", by Marion McCurdy [Nature, Trees & Flowers, Religion, The Spiritual, Mythology & Folklore, Heroes & Patriotism]
The principal reason I choose to go into the hedges at all is that the hart,
aware of itself, moves into full social provocation.
There it sits, querulous, seeking of one to give it courage to turn and face it, which I do not want to see.
I go into the hedges because that's where the beast is most at home these days, and there it sits
when it knows that one can feel its heart.
For this is a time when the animals are more in view than they have been in a long time,
and they are not afraid of us, in part because they are not very violent, in part because they are mixed
with something on the positive side.
For this they have given us flowers, which have some sort of weight, as
a bar or a base, and they have given us the fresh air.
This is the time of the hoping beast, and the spirit stirs as it waits to be inspired—
though it doesn't exactly know what it is waiting for.
It is eager, but it doesn't know what it is inspired by.
For it has lived enough to know that we are the pinnacle of its intention, and to a degree
it knows this desire, which it doesn't want to call need, but which it is as well.

2

We are deep in the holliness of the evening, the hedge feeding floor upon floor like
a picture frame, and day upon day, and the tree on which there is no sun, which
refuses to go at all, and has been referred to me as God-point(TM).
This tree means nothing, and in this atmosphere it means just what it means, for there is
no other way to mean nothing. The spirit means nothing, or its need to mean something
for its own sake, until it means nothing again, until then.
It feels this, and it is.
This atmosphere is the negation of all that the spirit has most desire for, in
that it has most desire for, in this atmosphere. It is the largest white circle
being picked out of a circle, the largest unopenable universe. It is the
negation of speaking. For it has
us bewildered, as if one could come to one's senses and one could not
have gone in anything close to disarray.

3

I see you. In the dim far
distance, and then I bring you back.
By the dim far distance, as if you were not there.
In the dim far distance, and you are.
So that what is fatuous such as mine can rise to the intellect and be borne
to the ultra spiritous tower, and be known. And when I say, "I saw you," it means
that I saw what was beyond, and that I wanted. That is the effect of the will,
of sustaining a spiritous intention, and such a keeping drives me to higher and
higher levels of being.
And I do not say, as I do not believe, that this is happiness, or that misery
is the same as no happiness, but that the former is pensive exhaustion, while
the later is exhilarated; so that my being is like a ship, that has
made one voyage, mooring and stuck, standing to receive shot into
its keel. From which point of space it strikes itself, and, I don't know,
rolling before it, or drifting, to the other, satisfaction level, but
unsatisfied—unstimulated. That is the state I beheld when I raised my
affirmation to the intellect, the affirmation of Nature in its natural
activity, which is another way of saying that the world is
dear to me.

And thus she mused, thus she mused, looking out upon

:  and sometimes, I thought
A distant Sister and I were two.

"Yes, this man -- if --
He thought me his brother;
With those sweet thoughts and tender
Obedience, prayers of a brother
With me;
Prayer that should mean
More than tears or breath
Of the brotherless seas
To the sister, broken sister

That we saw not -- neither thee nor me --
His sweet and suffering child,
Who doeth dreadful things
For her sweet God.
Sister! I love thee!
But with the woe
That he doth cause,
Thou canst not look on me.

"O! to see thy brother
Drain his very life-blood
In that dry, thin, bald head,
On which has time cast
The hue of the shade.

"Oh! to hear his gentle voice
As it may hear thee,
Upon my hand, when that is nigh
Is of all sweetest things,
To see his sorrowing face,
When I bring my inimitable
Face from out thy cheeks.

"O! to be mute,
And then to hear him pray,
By the tears that trickle down
To the blind eyes beneath,
In a loud drowning tone,
In fear I can never toil:
To soothe his fear with smiles,
"I cannot live without
Marrying love with love.
The world goes but as the market-man,
That moves as if suspended,
Plunges suddenly into the way,
And moves no more:
The heavenly races are handsame,
And man is only a reel.

"For me,
It is wisdom to quit it
With fulness of sweet hope,
And, turning to heaven, to stay
For a little while.
It is beauty to be seeking,
Though joy may well becouch,
For beauty is the course to know,
The course is-like-a-stream.

"You who are seeking still,
You are unsatisfied:
Your seeking hath found you unsatisfied,
And you are leaning still,
Without news, far, away,
Without friends, as you stay leaning still,
Nor enjoy good cheer.

"Ah! did you not tell me that!
A man that is unsatisfied
Fell out ere night.
The wedding's on Saturday,
That was not the night.
I look forward to you,
The happy, happy day,
Not the bower, bowerful day!

"I seek to live
My life, as it is worth,
I do not seek to live it all
In a bower bower bowerful.
I hate to be a bridal-maid,
That pressest humbly
Where women smile.
And hear these words of mine!"

Softly at that moment's distance
She rose up softly to the valley,
And, not knowing where she was hurrying,
To her utter surprise the beauty
Of the place exclaimed as she drew near:
"Where nature prompts a graver course,
Is always art.

"--The world is so beautiful!
I don't know whether I like it
Amid a bandage.
Your soul must find it by heart-beat,
Or you will be glad when it goes,
It is so very small.

"--The gold of all your tongue,
Like the grip of a black-thorn,
My head has felt callowed off.
I am so wide, I wonder
If I know my own younding
That a tree is.

"--To be fair, life is not fair
In my heart, I am so sorry,
I daresay you don't like it,
You say 'It's not my work,
And I don't like what ae they do.'
Leave hand in a restress tree
Would look nicer than that.

"--I am almost glad
That you've marriage-certified
That it's not so hard.
I would not be the bride
If that were best.

"--There is light enough for you
To see how the road is lay.
And we do seem to be
In nature very much.
If you were but fairly heard,
To you seem not far.

"--Not to be beat about,
But she did say you must
Have a flower for her."  Now the parson's dog,
Roly Rousillon, being a bruiser,
And a soldier of what was called the "square race,"
Was Kimmerley, in fancy, called "Heart of Oak,"

bear to. Say further, that he ordered
torches to be carried to all cities
of men in case they would amuse
the dulcet-eyed Women of the World,
the goodly-girt, be-dowed
Womyn of Science. So he
was called his fine old age,
his wondrous war-currents,
his prodigious voice, so that he
could shout, as Tyrtheledermyrt is shouting
to the motley tots of Peri cross,
and that these monsters shall
become a city every hour,
a city ready to call every man
in the world by his name, as I shall please
to label me my country."

Then the Goddess changed her veil,
twofold for the knowers
of it in the watch-dod:
under one showed the nations in
graphics, the subcontinents of
the world, under the other did show
geographic nations, as India
and China. But when she showed the nations,
the shiotgia had drawn to the nations,
each from their proper geographic
hole, the little world being shrunk
like a bubble to an l from that
world, because of the work of volcanoes
and not because of any pollution.
And the continent of Europe, continent
of ice, in the retreat of the volcano,
no longer was there a trench of water,
That the great mother of all
flame-lands, the great Mother of
Trophies, over-fatten and darken
during the long drought;
from the heights of Kerguelas, the fault
of the moon, to Naples, the position
of Naples, because of the earth
in its orbit, in this corner, and from
that position, Europe was
addition, was addition.
Europe was
Europe,
the mother of the world.
It is true,
a little time
in their lifetime,
as time goes on
they more and more
officially burn,
they are overrun
by the world-
son and world-sister.
As the coalspread out
in all directions, in
line of sight, the
timers boosted their
bodies, approached their
age, gathered their ages,
and found them there
packing their common grave.
Europe was
Europe,
the mother of the
conqueror nations.
The part that was not chopped up
neat was the mythological.
The rank of the mortal
was the common mortal.
So much for the visible
and the human,
the mythological.
Yes, you were mortal,
but you were not, you were
the son of Mythology.
You were not the mythological
because you were a mortal.

I tell you this, and I say
it with all my voices,
at all times:
man has died
in the body
so many times,
it is hard for me to name
the wounded unender
who could say it.

I am not a religious person,
and yet,
lest I be wrong,
I will be upfront and say that I believe
a God for two children was killed
in the body,
lest I be wrong,
and I have seen too many
God killings, and

even now, I see him.
I see him everywhere,
and if you do not want to see things,
stay away.

Now he can hold your hand, and when
he can kiss, and if you
do not want to be killed,
you will be reborn,
and we
will take a bath, and you will be
given a robe of meat,
and all your brothers and
your sisters and your
mothers, will tell you
where you are going.

On the other side of the wall,
there is a door,
and to open it, you will find

I have to tell you something.
I know it's risky to talk about
the sunflower, the ultimate source of
HA!
with one glance of its face.
It makes me feel
"high-anthem,"
back in the day, I'll have

I have to

to find the inbeity

It's not the first time I've done it

by having my eyes
eternally melted-
I came again this afternoon, this

To keep a pet is to understand that

to leave behind the fortune-

That some people think I am a villain:
Of course I'm White, of course I write
In bad blood (the old way), and therefore
We must all of us in the diatribe.
Why can't we just be glad that someone
Remembers that midnight relative picture
Of me in her basement, curled
Naked on a hammock chair, a girl
Who can't have gone dark.

To make pane or parlour, thus my case

Come no more;--she never was true;--

The maukins in the pennon,
Stray no more; the bells toll;
Never he led the dawn
To the sweet, green-hollowed mound

Within the fortress, day by day,
The same; the same; the river throng
From its abyss to its marge,
Seeking, weary of their quest,
Soft part of her they find not,--

Ah! have pity! Why should ye
And thy woman die?
With thy woman have no fear.
In the river lie twain,

Two that came from the same home;
Eyes twain and hair alike;
Yielding their lives,--and mine!
Go, trample, tread,
On the crowds of those that throng by.

The lover luters well,
The maiden does not shy;
Though between them wed,
A breath of love she dare not give.
Thither go, stand and cry:
I and my Rose!
Moons are made for lovers' tears!
Rose, I and my Rose!
Eyes and hair, and brows, and throat,
Hail to me only!--Roses,
Eyes and hair, and throat, and breast,
For thee alone!

When up through the mirk"Of ere"Wilt thou rise,
Blows I know well the hour;
When downhill sweeps thy drifting bark
From the loved one fair,
Who with weeping arm lacerated
Should take the words unsaid,
But I have thee always by the throat.

Thy spirit wings the wind invades,
Thy spirit sails the sky:
Eyes and eyes, nose and breast
The spells of thy phantoms wear!
In tears, out of sight, unslaked,
Till cold wenaments give place,
The innocence unquelled
Of my arms and my heart unquered
Brings tears in an icy flood,
And thy will done transcends all things.

There's no helping it; a pang-purring siren singing her round-elancing tune,
And she is the SPRING;
And she has sung herself into my heart, andsthraping my soul I know not how,
How strongly one feels one let the other speak,
But to one's self one isn't so mad;
And I have thought my ten ears must turn to hers, and left mine eyes to hers,
But her tone goes up and down,
And her fingers patter;
And her song has caught my thought in its strength and its eager lilt:
"I'm the SPRING riding over your back,
Over your head to fall;
Over your shoulder your dress can see;
Over your body your wing-like form can bear.
In the soft-flutey HOPP, hop of step,
In the acrid-blowing planting joint,
In the hop of leg to leg,
In the sharp hopping leg, the high flying foot.
In the gliding hop of dance to dance,
In the rainy hop of cricket,
In the ache and reuse of ball-play,
In the looping hop of leg to leg,
In the hop and burst of nimble roll.
I, too, have I" said naught of actual oak,
As in the laurel bracketed with flare and smoke,
But as white pines wanton to and fro,
So do my limbs move, my sounds, my tongue can say.

I, too, on this spring day,
Was singing the manner of the Spring,
When I too, singing, know the way to an open space,
And that slope of woods we call home.

Ah! the love of day that's gone!
Ah! the fall of a leaf!
I'll consider its day even though it are never
sunsets tomorrow.
I'll consider its afternoon, if it be only
sunsets, brighter than the day I counted then.

I'll consider its noon, or its noon-atmosphere,
Any moment, at any moment, in any world,
If its light the spectrum of space
See things warping, and turning and growing strange.
Wings will be let down, and eaten,
Wandered under by fairies,
And all the mire of the earth
Be kept clean as a fool's dream.
There will be time set for the waking mind,
And time given for each to do his best,
Time to rise and go and bring in the garbage,
And time for garbage to be burned and forgotten.

I'll consider its afternoon,
======================================== SAMPLE 350 ========================================
First Father and Mother, I abjure thee,
And thy lovers and those loving friends,
Who receive thee kindly and with wine;
O I now hear them declare the wine
Which hast bidden them to this merry day.

Thus when from wine and love 'twas thrown away,
The boy comes in his father's place to bed.
He trots daintily, behind his mane,
And if my gown the point of a mouse-tail made,
He blushes even at the name of "Dame".

And, 'fore the morning we are out of bed,
The wine makes us hot for our neighbours wives.
We've no time then to be tumblin' sober,
'Tis too hot our fingers are before,
And the wine we are pouting out
Because we are tired of the cooler clime.

But when the sun, that sets on the west,
From the rivershore slowly and with pain
Falls on the sea, and gilds the sky,
The souse going a-boatfull, and with smoaker in
Fills the big square-che starting slips.

The cove is passed, and we are down,
The masts are on the water,
And down the south bakes the snow,
And as I write, the pouring storm
And I can hear the thunder awake;
The mate came panting, and I said,
"Ay, and it's no use, I tuck mine,"
And he smiled and said, "Glad we'll be."

The anchor, bolt rough and flotationless,
The hempstitch bawlin' thin 'neath the sun--
This is all I claim for song:
A poor young man, with space but little head-rule 'être',
Time much less than a sirtian, lots of weeks,
In short, not even a month, to tell it short,

And yet with face askew,
And with gobbler ranting
And with hang breath,
And with latchart cool
And with great pullarr rude,

And with hands all brown
And with odd thumbs easily passin' them up and down,
Who, as the weeks in towards the end crawl by,
More and more get their miserable confidence pins--
I really aff duty tock on my own laundry;
And the more I see some folks loit'ring,
The more I think, t'oke of the fact that, somehow,
Somehave not all been soak-sacks to day;

God was my counselor, and I confess
His advice has been pretty stiff to get.
He says, "Hear, a gay good-luck tale,
A mile or twain, so tries the mind;
And while his eternal providence
A wise divine approve'cs shape,
Savour cherries of golden store,
'Twould taste most bestif it could be
As fresh as may spring,
Would taste most gracious, though it were
Early in May, when a dreamy train
With music sweet
And June-like warmth all supports itself,
And gentle breezes bear
The glow of such music along.

Then add the depth of aim
From genius, and the sweet
Side-bright courtesy
Of unashamed frankness:
And added with relish, which is just
Thrill-worthy miracle!
What need of curse or threat
If this same heavenly sort
Would tell me, time and again,

So writes and sings
As when he sings and tells
The same story so,
In presence of that friend,
Whom just now I've told
I'd fain pray Heaven
Have better care taken of him?

The waters have an element
Of tenderness. They shudder,
And then they cry, and when
Some hint of a star
Comes hot-swiring up the sky,
The seas, ye ken, their sad allegiance
Whiskers up and say,
"It can go all sums,
Where it is needed, 'tis true;
We feel the splendor,
But we're not so fine,
We can't, however,
Imagination make it,
Nor warmly dispense
With the gentle grief
That sometimes trouble us,
When a dreamy loft
Where glittering Angels hold
Their peak, a tower so high,
That long-untershallest
Look down on a limping, sorry,
Yellow, caution-needling plain."

When the fight's to turn it's on its back
And go still, oldy beatdown,
There are two fighting pieces left me.
I know, I know
They're twaining, but

For his beastly bisection,
A fee-lean'd testament.

to blind me
to the beauty of the world,
to the life-giving joy of
living.

What is this thing
but a monument,
an echo,
an ill,
an emotion cast
onto a living form?
You touch it, and you own it,
you feel it,

you make it,

and then
you die?

And yet, without
a human voice to say,
without the joy,
the fearless beauty,
the soft wisdom,
the tenderness
of hope,

of peace,
I say it is not a thing,

but a place.

You touch it, you feel it,
you make it,

and forever.

And here, in this
soft summer evening,
in this European city,

at this end of the expressway,
the sky sickens
from some distance;

a man screaming, his
face a swollen

mouth; a small

child wailing; and, in the sky,

a dying light.
I, too, appear,

a man; a hand,
myself; the memory

of what I did;

an echo,
a crying infant,
my baby,

a mother loved,
a girl,
her body open

like pleasure,
her face white

from shame.
And then, without reason,

the sick man moves,

the screaming woman moves,

the infant is crying.
I see her

as woman, my own

fierce self—

the body, the face,

far too perfect
for the white

to pantomime

of white

and sin.
And you—
what white

is this?

This white

humanity?

And you, too,

who saw the metal

of money as she
did,

the treacheries of man?
What white

self
to choose you?

White

and human?

If I had laughed
at thirteen,
at all the sex

and violence
the sopranores

taught me,

then I too might choose,

without choice,

what white

and human

I can think and say,

without choice.

With unquiet hearths, and slumbers mild;

Its gardens sleep; the ghosts of forgotten eras

Glide timidly along its wood-egged streets,

Like rainbows on its midnight wave.

Whither, then, dost thou wish to go?

Whither?--if thou couldst, wish ever!

For that which forgets no more, no more
The tombs that dread its sprawling flank,

Shall hear thee in thy stupendous wings:--

Woe, that the awful, awful, only whim--
Till--well--look out of its gaping hole!

O old, silent cemetery! grand, mighty cemetery!
Look out of your gaping mounds and murmur your strong refrain.
Look into the vale at night--its star-ship has landed on its breeze!
The skies are blue and glow with a soft, calm glow--
Our wings are behind us and the ground before!
The space that is circling us is like the Universe-- nowhere to go--
And the goal that is waiting for us, far down below!

As I, who do his races from time-to-time, know too well.
For I, who was once him at the hands
Of one that did not look on him come and go
Full kindly, did both haste and break both strongly
Down the Strathearo, past all his other doors
And markets complete his seasons clinking,
Until the Castle in cuck pressure
Seized me--and now, O he justice display
Full man-shape in the tallirin' iron-bound,
I see him still at the lifts, but I see
My bright friend's shape taller, taller, taller.

If there be charms so precious and sweet,
If there be beauty, that nought can dull,
If there must be one perfect beauty,
My love to crown, I wish it were yourself.
Flatter about the curls of perfection
As you never yet have from the curls of hers.

O that you were here, my thank-ful Matty Marso,
It would be an old tradition, I daresay,
That you had brought a donkey in your wise, black car.
Full many a time I have heard people say
That when they went with you upon the zip
They took in front, that when you stepped apart
From the dapple that is slowly unrolling,
And down into the small hoops with you
The audience clapped, cheered.
And there you stand, with your eyes

... and bade her, young Vayla, be seen no more.

'She came in her full strength, and wasted down the stair
Into the room where Tú is laid, and said, "O friend,
Speak with the King, who loves you both, with me draw near.
O Mayay, he who seeks the Lord of all has need of you.
So, say your say, and press your lips to mine in prayer.
And thou, say, in turn, what wilt, for the world is sore
And I am weariness and lack of sweetness at the end.'"

And through the virgin's golden hair and chest were seen
The threads of gold; and thereon none ever laid
Hand upon the hair as though it were gold and wax.
So rich was she that on her bed of lawn she lay
That the sharp sunbeams might have glittered there a space.
So great was she and so observant was she,
So noble was she in brows so grand and so jet,
That her body had no swathing except her soul.

As she had said her prayer she turned to go,
And never a look asked for on the girl she loved.
O Lord of all the goodly Oats for which we wait,
Had she kept her self aside and stayed the maid,
And made a condition that she should be her own
Through virtue of her sex or because she was fair,
She might have had the lady's favour.

O Mayay, her mother said, be not so brash;
You've done more than one should to scorn your own.
Yet go you sometimes to the festival?
And sit you down before the master of assemblies?
And bid he see you when awen, sir?
We will have to consider the mean behaviour of the fellow.

Oft indeed he visits us in his slops;
For we have introduced him thus, and think he is not equipped
To manage grace at a festival, a ses Vandal,
Before Tullia the maid with her high Norfolk nose,
And a wonner Guise than can be managed by a man
Who is not yet half so ux and half so wondly
As Mayay, the maid whose name everyone addresses
With words like gol, won't, and whom some heart seeks to love,
With the look of, well, never mind, as most do.

This is the way he takes his trouble into himself
And talks of opinions, so we get our pick
Whenever he's in a frolic so as to have
His trouble into himself.
Then when he's in a pickle
Between us, or between himself and us,
We shall approve of what he scorns and praise
What he approves.
But he's got to pay for the trouble he's bore
With his blood, you see--upon his hands and knees.
And thus the torpid age of complaisance
Become swiftHDlashing hoofs of a thirty-two-stool
And ninety-five-times privy to the spot
Where he ascends, where he sits between the head
And chiefest part of the kingdom of waste
Which fixes the term for which his wits must run,
When the absent trilogy reappears in every scene
Where the wisps grow obvious,
Must become such that we can't see where he is,
Must feel so strong that we weak people determine
That the nature of Divinity is a indestructible mystery,
Unchangeable in point of man or order of the universe,
Begining out of chaos and enduring as it were on errand
With whatever incidents are necessary in the way
To change its modifictory points of repetition,

He's old, I say; and you have a general kind of picture in mind,
Absurd as be your protagonist be, the last of his race
All the tempests he endure entailed, in the manner
That his ancestors had, as a matter of course,
No doubt, a custom, a custom what couldn't but be current
In that case, among the black-eyed Africans, and may have
Hind cast their eyeballs and are what you describe,
A disgusting custom--we'll call it true to keep it pure,
But we leave it just that it be true--till the expiration
Of the day duly have greeted an unconsidered wish.

It is plain that when a man's in the current of life,
As men are often in want of life as soon as a man's born,
He doesn't think of anything, nor of anything imminent
That may change his condition.
And as to his religion,
They say it's just a tolerated creed, not a religion that permits

We are rich in the eyes of the globe.

"Carolina Poem", by Elizabeth Barrett Browning [Living, Death, Marriage & Companionship, Love, Heartache & Loss, Relationships, Home Life, Arts & Sciences, Poetry & Poets, Reading & Books]
What wavers not this fleeting life

But Love?—No matter by what cause

We are again faced with the same white hands

Bleaching our quiet pages in its flow,

And with less clearness the morning sun.

That face is older than our faces:

It trembles round us as he turns away

From the still pool where a great plague bird fights

In a gray sea sea of blackness.
We knock and examine a wood
Of foreign sticks, that seem to smile

Suddenly with absurd little griefs

Only we, some moment93 years old than you,

Already see through the transparent age

Some old-fashioned quality about you

That old-fashioned face...
But who that ever shall see through the tear

Tears the real nature of men and women

Of nature's ancient times

Whose fundamental love is love?

When gentle Youth and pert Stonelie paint

With Scrolls the swimmpt grass, The soft orchard's delicate frame

Is overflowed with Larks, The tall grey poplar stands

A daring work of Arts; Men work in Shipsteemen, then They sell

And snug themselves attired pleughly: So, reader, my soon

Clicking will open crates of Shipsteemen:

The Custum's a pawn; the Muster is a starring

Of clanking, unswing windows

By old Nicholas, who (bightly he bleached his edges)

Gleeful, fabulously rich, A true New-year's pictur'dRoom, with panes of power

And thunder'd oak vaults crimping with rubies. (A rustic Rose is planted

On rich Shell-bustard trunks, like relics of grimmest fate.)

But lo, hapless I! in frolic dressing most beseldome,

Which rais'd my inhead, save Anger only, cri'd my pain,

Some worter multiply'd behind my calm, Peaceful air! my sleep would open

The marvels of my life: Nor will the smallness of my snivelled heart

Suffer me to kiss Chipp, or to wrestle with the Frowning Face

That dwells around sweet Beauty: But the great Shadows will not stretch

A-striving under the blue; The Wisp of shadows shall stretch and cease

Ere long over me; the Stars will not dart their lightning round

My native Zodiac. Dear to the Budding Moon new-shapen in me

Are the deep swaths of her loveliness,

Like that anomalous Pantheon which neither suns, nor horns,

Nor other stars, nor gloaming Arrayed in shirt of immedicable eyes,

Gluster in the deep, which all the Gods adorn,

Nor, reeling through immaterial fires, Them all night telescope,

Swells into a fine explosion topmost, Which from their mutable height merrily cuts

With sharp crescents dart'st in each unmeant Target of Will

With round analyst glance. (I say only on their dart's body

Their design indeterminate; But the dart in flight is chaste,

An on-run of thunder: Every shot from thy bow,

Anticipation of what then strikes me,

Bears bow new-born skin of many hues.) Now, dear Moon, shine thou sweetly

The idle, pleased, to live disjointed,
And selfishly give themselves the care,
And other people none?

I'm against keeping quiet,
Against a sense of humor;
I'm like an old theatre fly,
I'd rather bite.
An old theatre fly's a play

An old theatre fly is
No more a worm.

Of preaching to the weary,
Of proofs, objections;

For wind, for wo, for woe,
For round, hard ground, I'd rather be,
On dark, windy precipices,
(Where nobody sees me walk).

For if I pine for any one,
It is a riot
Of discouragements,
A fluttering, a dismembering,
An unscathed divorce
Of duties, supporters,
Of cuckold soothings.

At twenty-one I left home,
I think I ne'er was welcome.
My coevals seemed evown,
They say I tarry in church,
But I'm eligible.

Before the open door she stooped
Upon her reverend knees, and gave God thanks for all
Her pity and wealth, and then with her dear chain
She laden, as in old days, a poor maiden,
Spoke the fervent prayer, and led the little children
About, as duty led.

And when she went to lead the prayer.
It was the dawn of day,
Before the solstice.
The silent forest, like the world, was still,
And a small moon hung in the blue.
The long grass glittered white
Where the wild grape grew;
The holly holloahed in the wind;
And the maiden, sleeping by the cottage door,
Shouted a hosanna:

Lay down in yonder quiet place,
And stay your steps to-night.
The hush-dance of the quiet moon
Will carry sound and shape to us,
And we will hear and see,
By the blaze of Binniane's golden towers,
The splendor and the glory of Milan,
And ever farther away, shall carry
The music and the flush
Of one white hand brushed over white linen!

Monna knows you of such sorceries,
And those who sway her hidden trade;
And some are bows and some are wings
And most are not at all:
She takes and denies you--she, who knows
All bows and wings, by the whole of heaven
And earth and sea, by sea and land.

Dropping into a hive of sharpening combs
That sit on high in a little frame house
They have built high on a hill.
With a tilt of the head and a swing of the hand
And a whisper of the tongue that goes and goes,
Borne by most alone.

We are not forgetting you in the night.
With a snap of the fingers gins in and out
The sky and sea.
And I know you are there with the waves to climb,
And the rocks of life claw with their heart gleams
And wrap around your limbs.
And you never will fail,
You that are tingly and tiny and strong
In a world that loves to throw
Its hardest questions at your pigheaded breast.
And yet you never will fail,

"Bees", by Robyn Waldfell
They had their day— that bear was it—

Billed in the year with them, five, or four—

Billed in the year— that's how it seems to us

By the time we first saw them panic-shed

And bore them that January night,

We should usually see them another day,

But one turned up dead and another,

So each that followed had gone back to keep—

Billed in the year— but that's too simple a story.
Our five had only the night to make it.

The wind's first light that arrived with the bear

would never turn in by night,

March or 48 hours, and so they had to—"Bilign—

Is—is" the way the biologists use,

for that matter, and so they took their pass—

Billed in the year. The month and year are ever a-dooming

them, and nothing happens after that.

The golden sun sinks down and dies,

There's a ship in the midst of the shine,

The steam up to the light

Well!  How do you?

Whom do you think you are? a dog,
Or a goose, or a swan, or a fall-glutting,

And then you go away, and sometimes
I listen, and I hear;
And I like it.

That's the world-of-tomorrow, and over-world-of-wheels,
And I'm not as other people are,
And I'm not as other people are.
And the thing is,
As I sat one winter evening and one winter midnight
Looking at the stars out of the window of The Boley Ball,
All of the toys I saw on high
That I could buy with gold,
Tow-headed-cat, all other cats
Came much too slow, and said too seldom,
But brought them too close and went away.
But the stars did come too soon, and stayed too late,
And I missed them too far.
But the moon
Could not come on over.
And the clock-women, when they knew me, and men knew,
Were in the ball-room at the southeast corner of the hotel,
But not alone.
They came too near and went away.
But I missed The moon
That time.
I have to settle up the 
Balance now.

Fairies did it by knots,
By which I got them to follow me,
To go with me to the herb, and there I say;
And fairies can trouble, I did say.
I said, 'I will leave thee, and ah, make no more.'
Then they were to come from the garden, and they did;
I threw off my body, and they burned, and I laughed,
And there I am.
They crossed themselves, and they made friends of me,
And I said what I wanted was not particularly
To be distinguished by a tail, now I amqueath my tail
To be the fright of rats, till I am gone hence.
And fairies may trouble, I did say.
I'll to bed, I did say
What I would do, which was to read the cards now
If I could.
And what I should choose, which was not to live,
'The wind has changed, and I do not like the gales.'
The wind does change, but not to my liking.
And fairies may persecute, I did say.
In the old fairy city,
They are still who played with her,
She sees the little lights on her ways,
And the great fairy trees,
As she was told, and her cedar tree
And her dear cedar friend.

She dreams at least she may crawl

With her green and green, green leaves to show,
And her yellow et cetera,

The dreamer within. What gold cloud-compelling power
Hurls us from out the mind's eye out of reach places,
To unknown starry lodges! What marvel there
Of inward thought and dreaming on the wing!

There is an ancient story, it's my own
Told of the Englishman who wandered about
The wilds of northern Italy with Peter,
Found foxglove growing there and ass's-eye,
But ne'er had seen a wild rose or a red rose,

False tale indeed! And yet to me it had
A more than pleasing sameness, like a song--

To think of the cold broth,--but smiling said,
How in the world I might feed my little feet
Up toenantly, as cowslips do, "down
To the depths of Paneus, where the sweeter thaw
Suffers the grass, and thro' green lanes of snow
Up to green towers and glassy splendors, there,
As if we but entered 'vere willi to look
At some ruins, or at a fair old town, or caught up
An agateskeleton, or even a bit of Goos Dodge
And crooned soft on a plaintive draught, while you sat there,
With the wild bee vies, in your strange rapide,--'tis there
You wax perfectly sweet, from the heat of sun
And kiss and song, with the peace that glides away,
And a sense of endless cycles, and the breath
And foam and writhing insectments of seas,
And all the wet silliness of elfin shapes;
And there we sat, you stifled many a sob
With comforting all things with a comforting smile,
Till I would tell her, were 'twere word or cake,
'Tis timorous fate--you know and I
Had jumped at the word--but first--let us go
To Myrtle's Gap and take a bath upon the rock.
The period is no more! The holm-looted brooks
No more with their tramp no more do they with roll
What we olenty persons call life, ye ken?

No more, madam, no more--my haggard years
Have erred with their endless years with you, I hold.
Nor any man more lonely nor moister nor stander by
The close of the intense love with the hide around him;
And neither you nor me at that elfin thrillin' hath
The quiet nurselings--where the lone birch still is bending
Her age in barin'--to tend--and spin a shell-like rhyme.

What knows the spirit the spittle?--the smile it falleth
From people unseen, speaks the love what none beholdeth,
Soothes sorrow with its ease, and the hollow wind with its sound!
I might go on like a bore, and the holy-days keep me fixed
Indo their tumultuous graves, the complete wastes to roam among.

They ask you, then, to describe your wonder-going
And the desire that is an unbearable interest
Wherever you have been. Tell of the exquisite
Snow, and the--fog that o'er the lone fields dews to flow,
The exultation of the lover, and all desires
To which you have been underversed.

You, and you sister--we are going to play
In the dawn of a magic night!
Hark to the horn, and follow me inside!
We shall throw by the clothes, and girdles, and all,
And quiver our shaking bands in a frenzy,
And rise on little feet and feet,
And in a minute she'll a spring, and I'll say,
(As long as the beast I choose can be undone)
And she'll fly on her tender weak knees

She's as sure to win me with her head as body:
She's as ready as I am to spin her in a cage;
She's as sure to get easy, and stay it, if I do:
There's no woman that can move me more dizzy
Than her heart, when she has got me at sixteen or so.

Hemming the strong hands of the
dwellers,

Warding the houses from sudden raiders;
Till one by one they fell in the
slaughter
And were carried over by the raging
fire,
To the dismal place where the harpies rove.

Lo now, ye that pass by that horrid
mouth of hell,
Lo, there upon the high seats of the

Lithe and watching the vultures.

Whom the King discrowned from
his throne at his banquet,
Stood one by one
Till he came down the western stair.
"O ye lowlights of my court,
Here take you all the scum
Of the wicked," quoth he,
"The worst of me! for once I WAS
King of all of them poor apes and
birds,
And hadsoever monarch or lord
Either winged or limbless,
A king though now of lice-bits.
Fierce, foul, unruly, ungovernable,
wide, hungry, wild, greedy--is
the same after rinse as before.
I had a fit a good way behind,
And my early land was very broad.
I gave every man his green season,
Nor I kept a secret pact with slaughter;
My appetite was forsy/our new over
And my poor state was much less than
The king's, lay, than my good word then.
And I once telephoned a form and
equipped it for a poem,
But the finger of wire foundered
And the flaming creature/State foundered
In the manner of a fast fall of water
From the sky, from a cliff-edge;
And the mad child had no more to give
Than a cry of "blow this, break that,"
With a rattle of sticks after.

"A glad day," he said, "to all of you"--
We, by the by, on the gentle links
Did shoot him the eagle from the nest,
And the baby eagles did topple
As we admired him and we prayed to him
As we never had done before.

And the earth was so gracious about him
That men brought to student him the fall
Of him down to us from far places
In the air before ever he knew it;
And he whispered with a loud voice
At the first remission,
"I'm glad I'm a high-born Orion!"--
And "by heavens, you are!" we shouted.

And the king was sorry he was late,
And the men were sorry he was fat,
And the cooks were apologetic;
For we always waited with quite a smile
For the royal delivery party,
Though we hadn't seen his child,
And we had been certain that she was probably
Princess Aurora's own.
So the king, our subject, said,
As the prince, our royal, would:
"It's a very good thing for a prince
To have so many subjects."

We are seated all inside
Over against the wall,
And I am the lily
With Poppy's flower.
I'm the lily with the fiery breast,
For I'll take no leave
Till Poppy's flower be gone,
And the black-jay be in,
And the linnet begin her to seek;
And I'll take my love to bed,
And the thrush can sing—
When Aurora rides
Holding the reins,
As we go to meet
The little meadow-maid,
You shall see me pull
Each clover-head,
Until the full mead
 Be specked with our leaf.

By the timmer
In the red amounts
Of the silver-mountain hour,
I'll be waiting
In my foxhire,
For the harbacher
With the husky voice,
To say his part,

I was lying in a bed of green clover
On the first full moon of the year;
The wind blew over my marshy ground,
And pointed north, saying, "Sun, you must fall
Here to sun the garden, this year,
With or without planetary light."
I was lying in a bed of green clover,
The-wind blew over the great stone fence,
And pointed south, saying, "How like this season's queen
The north star is to-day!"
And south of the fence the sea-gulls screamed,
And the friendly house-fronts spoke
To the sun the patron-name,
And the mountain stream flowed,
And the woods were dewy brown,

Of country life and love,
His whole being I must render
Into the pleasing pursuit.

The gods to whom I look for help,
To whom I veil the naked soul,
Forsake me and I am a fool,
Struck with a paralytic thirst,
Thirst for that which I cart 'em in,
Trespass the gates that they give me.

No man is I ‎ ca, c. 1.
Who hath the knowledge of his own
Self in his thought, being clear,
And understanding all the rest,
Seeing all that comes to him,
And being patient, getting nought.

A man is upright who is true
To himself and to his fellows,
And holds as one that must be
Condemned in his world for good;
Knowing one way of being true,
And nobler delights than bliss.

Not so the man, expiring, dead,
Erect, of life despised, intombed
On corruptible earth, of all
One mass of disenchantment, all
One rank imbricker litter of dust
Each calcined heap of thought and hope
From all truths emptily expunged.

Ah, Jove, when all this breath is fled,
The mighty heart still will beat
Above the parapet, the star
Of man's hope! Above the tire
Of life and all its grievous toil,
Shall beat the steadfast, Godhead, brain,
And from heaven look down on earth.

If thou but be willing to break
This neck, the labouring world's collar,
Then hast no sin in giving
Earth fit body for the strong;
And being rich, as men are now,
Giving shall be twice as abundant
For those that give the other way.

So on I have not seen the harm
That was quelled by me. No pain
Has come to me in any way:
To do or to be, no sin
Incluss in my doing;
For what is that sorry matri
Within my soul that should
Count it sin to do?

To die
Is not now mine to choose;
But if to live within
This phantom of the body,
To do or to be,
Once more to choose would be choice
In choice of worse or better;
Though this he knew who has the last,
Of all the glorified
To know what is that command
Of the Ruler Infinite.

To be content with that
Is not my modern mood,
Which walks with buttocks invisible
Through this Pan or any other
This is the Man's attitude,
Who walks with feet bare,
And has his head and shoulders spare,
And drinks whereasters live, and eats
Most sweet of honey,
And seems in every part
To have purged his seasonous path.

Not purged his or her breast;
Nay, but akin to this,
That he walks all hands and head
Along his Master's ankle,
And lifts up his face and bows
To thy giv'n focèd face
Who sweetly speaks for good,
And mildly shakes, when will be done.

For such full times I see him stand,
And then adorn himself,
For group too great that now doth lie,
And in his breast most wondrous grace
His whole aspect adorns; and when all stands fair
He sometimes bendeth to the broken waste,
To hear the holy noise of hymns
From some pure flow'rs that he passeth through,
Where, as he peerest wide-stirred to and fro,
He stoppeth down and looketh skyward now
At times, his heads locked in vision.

And what is that, because it shows
The hidden riches of the mansions?
Scarce any crescent of old doth show
To this clematis of such trim hospitality
As may qualify it for all men;
And yet upon it smile the guests?
And yet it tells of years gone by.

It tells of strength of old finish'd houses,
That, fittest to the use, doth show
Strength fitteth to be blameless provided
With something of their fellow-walls,
With something of the Augustus time.
No torch required it;
It found its keepers by the fire;
A country cro'lay did it best:
The "going" it did appear
Was not to show of time unkind;
No prince's depredations wan
Within such walls, nor Ohio's rash ambition.

And now I go.
The lilies of the valley
Vibrant in the bright sun's gold.
Tall firs,
Like vessels full of flame,
Burn in the forest.

And now I go.
The winter twilight, profound,
Hangs thickly, dullly,
Over the world.
And now I go.

Thou, too, wast silent, dear, when I lay among the rushes.
There, with thy brother sisters, quietly, without a word,
Thy prayers rose up, without stirring, without sound.
And for such a season they were upmost needed,
Peacefully.
Thy thoughts,
Coming from distant worlds,
Were in a way of sunshine like thy prayers,
Songs in your thoughts,
Foes to cheer up with,
Wains speaking good words.
And so you were not quiet, I knew why I rested
Among the rushes;
For, talking with a friend who specializes
In these things,
I learned, you knew,
Thou art going to live off the world,
And have a holiday,
And turn, if the world sells things,
Into the new thing;
Thou thinkest, of course,
With all the good faith and honesty

I came to thee with one leaf
In my hand.
When the daylight was swallowing
The bodies of the dead, I found thee, I knelt you,
Seeking that which once thou art,
As it then was, in God's garden,
Or ever it was.

And this is the first, last, last time I'll ever
Ask a debt of gratitude to thee,
Sky, sea, pen, tablet, and eye!
For heart is wax that has no soul left in it,
And these wild flights are weary;
Call away the instinct of the grass!
Depart for the dead, and come back!
We've souls to spare, and we will live.
In thy light we are tired, and in the darkness
Lie down again.

The morn had called, and robed the wests,
When bright the rays of grace
And new creations sprang from each thought,
Trailed like springs
Of last year's blossom or the year's
First perfusete flowers.
It is the season--time is over,
And night's dark shroud is short;
Let me, O night, which loved thee so,
And thou, dolcy.

Thou, which it didst appear, O Moon!
Or thy light cowling, didst bear
Day under your hand for spirits' sake,
And shed light upon us, didst touch
Our tongues with sounds of great beauty,
Wherewith didst make sweet quick
Short phrases, like the words
We would our heavens proclaim,
Wherefrom the Moon, O Moon,
Answers us--our mind's first speech.
Didst bleach this earth this moon from
Her body of light, to make
Spaces sweet, varied, full of
Locohes, and shadows, stars
For no one word but one, to say
Man is raised, and stone, and soul.
Then, light being past for ever,
Let the night bury its head,
With shadow on shadow,
And all night-woven ill
Forget its windy finger-work,
Which now seems to us
As time's finger-work, and behind
Which is as moon the sun,
To whom from sun and hence
Song was given to be
Of all the songs that can be.

And of the grave men talk but now,
And to be dazed and mad and blind
Is not for me, I will not be,
No, not if in the dead man's name.

But if, like you, I serve the King
And pay the blessed tribute,
When his cot I've a-gley, his gun,
And all the day as he am me,
I will be free as a king's fisher,
And shout my licence--Lord--let me live.

So now, brothers, now that the battle blows
And our broadbeams tail and spatter,
We will sing to the fallen and the dead,
And comfort them and say: "We too were brave."
Let none make his own rules the state
Führers, the state-stoppers of the stolid,
The heirs of the glutton and the sinner,
Who bring not their whole selves to the mart.
We will go out to the wideness of the green,
Who shall not the wauing self-tears bear?
We.

What, dead men! living man! you men of peace!
Freed are you from fear of death,
From the thrill of fear, and the unlock'd mind,
And the gaze of eyes you could not trust.
Now come, and weave your swords into plough-shaft,
And take the seek of God and the just;
And live neither more nor less than a waif.

I know a stroll
In the meadow
Shall make you high or low,
Make you a wonder to
All children after;
Body and mind,
Will I keep the same,
You shall not haffard go?

So the shade
Crept ahead close as you
Went in go;
Walked he slow,
Walked he fast,
But before you went,
He did not that one
Child to scold.
For he saw you
Was not at all they,
And he mind'd the story
Beveringly,
And he said as I,
"Your Father's kind as from the Devil,"
Seemed to say as we,
"Aren't we all kind from the Devil?"
O, the children's shall
Say to the dead,
"He kept us late to bed!"

Now you are armed
And trained with guns;
Now you're floating round
In a ferry at the window-glass;
No more by pothOrings or creak or clink
You sight plain or balcony,
Now you're cannonade wary,
And having gone home to your fire,
Ready with your prayer
For your next march with the flag;
For which you've left the quiet
Tree-canopy to tell us
Lark or sun or woman
Has in secret gone incognito,
Or lastly to the grave gone;

But as we passed
On our way to the curfew,
As we were leaving the Church;
Something seemed to stir in the road,
And we two went a little green;
A ray of the August sun,
Like a brook from Wonderland;
Twas a veldt where Nature might stride,
Where the souls of the men of summer
Four au pairs each drew.
Like evening beer-drinkers
The fairest in the land,
They stood in the pave,
Theatre-dresses, at a glance;
Brown-dyed sweedish-pall,
Or comely-spotted skin,
They kept passin
For their bouquets, au fait
Full of dailies and dearth,
All freshly smelt and dew.

And a little way hence
They saw a little company
Of oaken boxes and barrels,
And there was talk of spittin
And blue-staining teeth, and spits
Of tea and punch.
And the way they came among
Some ruddy cabins, in which
Was a still face on a coffin;
They thought that the springin
For more was the two pence wanted;
But they only drank decaf
And wentin' a little further

I will tell you this; for it stands
In the factus, and not you

Called not spiez. O happy day!
If the King were back in England!
And when he was not in France
I knew him, and he's "far in gold!"
I will swear that in his pay
He is as good a banker
As a spy, or any thing;
And his army of young slackers

There was not one of all the family
But had borne something of the affair
Of the cruel birth-work.  So the word
Of this good man spread itself through all
The kindred, and was heard at last.

When Judith did hear
The death of Constance in the great hall,
In the high keep of Caesarium
She put up a smother of flying
Silence, and all were listened to.
And the wise kings it seemed at length began,
Wondering, to unstone the tomb, and found
And opened the bread of life.

A deafened generation hears no more
The solemn summons of the voice
Of God to the great lobby of death,
Where a vain and icy mixture
Of passion and surrender
Has acted for the silence of the sinner,
For the revivals of faith and of love
And the search for righteousness, and the redreams
Of prophecy; -- the tumult and clash
Of this proud octave of imminence.

Over the trasitional gates of earth
It looks not yet; o'er us and the living
It looks; while blinding phantasmal death,
And day that is his olive, and the light
Of dead days, are seeking still some way
And message of the eternal word,
In the yet unrisen days; -- in the now,
When this our whiteness bursts upon the eye.

He raises a mighty tempest in the sky,
And the worst of it bursts upon us now,
Whereat we still live; but it is less sweet
Than the swells of the absent sweet sky,
And thin as the taste of reeds above,
And without chance of respite.  It drowns
Our livers, and hinders the births,
And calls life into our wills faster; breeds
Prelude on death to some that die;
And grasps the living hand. -- It is true,
Though we have not love's look, or embrace his breast;
If it were so, by this reserve
We should not trouble the spirits so.
And the greatest flood of life's pure gift
Is not resistible by the sea
Or clouds that struggle over writer and man.
It is true in the least austere man-seated
Chamber mightily the poured-up sea,
Now thundering on the cliffs, now sweeping down
The mountain slope at one leap of huge wings.
He counts his gift, and weters as he goes
The durstest of his plethoric deeds. -- But we
Wait our depths by dreams and deep sleep,
And the white shining of the spirit's eyes
That wakes the dead.  The mercy of the Lord
Shall be to soften the swift time and its work.

When the North cometh, it is dark below,
And the trees swell in magnificent wrath;
When the North cometh, cometh the armory
That we knew not; and the tower by the wall
Is new firerated, new grimated; the snow
Lies in fresh-dropped chunks on the square, white,
And the rapt in the circling wings of the sun
Is a first or last greatness:  yet or before,
The enchanter leads his train
Through the dense air, or in the open bay,
It may soak a square of space the livelong day.
Now the will of the multitude is gathered,
Now the round wants are rolling, cartwheeling,
With the unknown servant at the table of
Oppression; where the wickets dropt
Their loads no longer, and the tariffed
Passengers, waftside up the downgrade,
Passing side by side, where the waters
Have scented them; then shattered and still,
They describe in writing the nearest way.
Lo! it was night; ere long it was
Full-thrown snow, that on defecent wings
Collected drove a way the squalls
And the full battened heart of the earth,
Till all the open water spoke and raftered
The vales, with an art that was new.
The Alps hold forth, with a gesture vague
At the skies, a menace to let fly
Whose dripping lash rose red and tost,
And filled flat plain and lowland sandy tilled
With a nauseous and constant sob of sobbing.

And then one morning, when the time was swept,
The open waters had changed them to water-stars,
They looked down in a sight of sightly danger;
Sitting at noon, in a boat that was being
Retained, or at least was water-swaged, they saw
The face of a cruel-looking beast

In Old Irish are as in the first line.
But having read in the margin "boda doibh nodh doith,"
I can't help noting the peculiar spelling of "O.

"Now it happens, when they are travelling in Ireland,
They get the cattle to some cattlemen,
Who are kindly thanks to them for allowing
Their animals to feed in their stalls;
But when, at least, the animals are nearly
Over tired, the courtesy ceases
And each wished the best of it.
The Englishman says, in all civility,
"We wish you make ourselves quite clear;"
And the Irishman, "We wish you well"--

"O the Child's Play Book.  One little book."--
"The Pilgrim's Pills" was written by a Rhetorian,
But the same man--who has been many things,
From a Saint Pauli Pimpermonkey, and
At a time when the Performers were few and far Between--was at last elected to the number of Bards that live with the Hammer, and so on Sunday mornings, when one pops up in bright chiq.

O the Child's Play Book! one play into two days
Of my life, and I've got all the times as well
As any one else, for which, as they say, is damn well suited.
But, O me! what most grinds and burns one's author
To hear is not there--isn't there!--not there!--
'The Mermaid Theatre,' the play the Dutch
Never saw that shows so good.
But 'tis in force now, they say, and tonight is our
Blow-'em-dry night.

Who the Devil is he, with the green hat
And the red mouth, to tell the red story
Of our loss to the mariners?
They are thinking of the end of the world, and they
Are old of the world, and its end is
Right back of the speaker, and he has a staff
Which they pluck, to begin the day's work,
And they are up and away to his stage
With his green and red cap and his red band,
And his green and red hat, and his red tip.

All about the Mermaid Theatre
Live melancholy thoughts, and burn with regret,
For they are an olden speech by now,
And 'tis high time they were out in the sun
To concert and theater echoes--although
Their hearts and souls are with us yet.
So they have gone from the shores of the Sea,
And the fields of Ulster, and they have brought
Their bluff, and their blunt, and their bifurc'd stock
Of olden times, and words whose sound has gone
All about the world, and is like smoke,
When the tempestures of brimming rainfall
Hear through their boomling windows made
By the rains of the eve, and the light
Of the blushful Sun, and they look
With a yearning look, with a weary look,
At the Mermaid.

How they despise, with a brain sedate,
A subtle, smooth, refined, arrogant heart,
A brain well manufactured for defiance,
For the purpose of destroying the law
Or God at any time, and the law of love
Of God's absolute heart; for any cause!
They sit in their spots, the blue and the open,
Well bought, well bartered, well sought after seats
Buoyant with pride, which rests sublimely
On the slim possibility of wrong,
Though white and baneful it be.

For these my Powers are over-possessed;

To that King buried in the bones of St:Peter-3
And lift they head they shall, nor long ago
Did ye arise to go up where he doth sit
Who is the true Jesus, and shall come, years hence,
Probably to sweep the seine and garden whereof I
Strew cards no more than get people Slain by the knaves."

A lark was hovering, luvin mind how long,
And cease he might not rise to know

When tweed was as the morn and day, since he
Was frae mortal man, and of his sins was telling;
When wakened he rose and looked about to see
If any wenner or pilgrim were there;
But there being none that wondered then
If he should seem one, she up and spake him thus:

She spake
And parted thence and made unknown the end
Of her imagined journey, which did nought but
Drive her from her heart; for she could ill brook
Fare to be bound of flesh by mortal men
For ever, whiles she loved her Creator so,
That though despard spring though putrissake, or wheat
Crab or praffrement, were in thing lacking proven,
Still would she for him vaunt and vainly vaunt,
And be a galantries; but now all else
She held with targes, and the cause is this,
Her will is sweven, her purgings growing vporned
Day by day against the wolke of her hand
And sauing to despaire: and to-morrow
Fond she her tun'd or gretplesse of wil
Should for his young beautie commend
Or fall a spaire to commend her son
To whome she wasted nameless hours over.

But with full sperrits, as boding of mis aged,

From his neck like cordage,
Swimming upon the surface,
Like a little fish,

Pleigh, pleigh like windles,

With a bird's blue wing,

Where the old leaves fade:
A song for Charlemagne,

And cast our nets in calm,
Where life is most a wanderer's life,
And best unavailable.

Is best when done with.
In state we meet--comme derred,

Should go when we rise,
Nor we question whether,--
If spirits dip and dip
They also go,--
For a man to the world
By a way must go.

Nor do we love to be
Upon the tearful, tearful side;
But ours are ardent and true

He's a something for, yeah, yeah!
And if you're motherly--
A mother here, a mother there,

That's a lot to be afraid of,
For a man to the world
By a way must go!

What a man's stature, and pen
Your stature, and pen
Is now a little lower,
Your pen is a little higher
For a man who's thinking now
About something fairly elementary,
Something the devil never thought of.

If you're not a man who thinks
Of what the world might be
To him at fifteen, be still more
Somewhat imperfect, be more
Likely the skimmiest feeling there
To the law of averages.

I have notchkied us millers
To drive the odd wood wolf
To our lairs of berries,
But I have routed us merchants
To get us gold and silver,
And thought of everything pertl (that's "behind"),
And thought of everything edgy

We have everything pertl and chill--
Everywhere and everywhere,
But never have known whelm (else you drive
Those men that drive),
The thought of what the world might be
To a man that's in.

We have learned to think day never dead
In our meat and usage
(No use going where the bugs may sting)
And every fruit is fortnightly red
By the infidel we crave your blood.

Thy voice was so soft and sweet, and those eyes,
Whence all love dwells, lovely with their beams
Of that young, heavenly, angelic light
Which turns to dew-memoried mysteries
Such warm, forbidden lights in such as these
To make the sum of love divine.

Hands of velvet tied my wrists and ankles;
Chained my lips with the touch of thine own;
Given to me the humiliating gift of thatus' wings,
And made me darling of that God alone
Which is king of kings, and God of loves.

Here, with a'dolly velvet and th'anazened

Tying me so fast in bonds of sweet mariage,
Thou didst wed my soul unto thy sin,
And gavest me, to the fetters' happy rope
The world's choking place in Christ's golden chain,

An holy cry from under the wire
Of the swift wheel the hail of your mad ship

only his nostrils breathing showed that he had lived.
Then from his raiment he dispelled, and put on

"For, lo, I am one who loves his art thrust in between
the fingers of a strong male hand. Wherefore
this hand that thine own has made, thy love

acquainted with you, has from you that story. Her
way was known, and is now disgrac'd. Amen. She shall be for-
done with soon. But I there too far earlier had fix'd my
eyes; for what with this the builders of this frame
might I say. Now since I, my Lord and myself, see
all things in one, recognize then by his vice-like-
sire, who was ruler of the woodlands, tyger Cabiū's
son, Laso Tur; that the most and best of all thy

some long interval there will be risen at Alumelle

"My dear counsel," answer'd Hector, "seems dearer to me,
because it arouses one's wonder at the Gods; and
for by it one hopes to win some beginning of revenge.
Thou, therefore, with not the desire of spoiling or
of making me high-brazen, nor of adding to my fame

Iguanodon thy father, calls me not so much now as a

tainer. Never the certitude of my hopes have I
ascended, but as one much-at-ease. Let not the
half of me be spoil'd, but the entire me, that even
earthly glory may ripen. So much of my life do I desire

Then, as it chanceth oft, so will it now. Slain
withal, let me not to mere silence bring, but let me
pardon and let me kiss thy feet. Never in all the Isles
did I;--whither would go nearest, I or Zeus? for
the Cyclops' wide heart is not more cover'd with armor
than mine: behind me far lurk I nought but my guards.

'Tis every day as fresh as when the great light
Of yesterday darted down the tunnel,
And the sweet kisses of first-love, unworn
By the cold tomb, bear witness to that kiss,
To which the strong worshippers return,
Pleased with the fresh-kissed shrine
To which their lips and hearts are ached.

I'll take the faithful pen and penance blunt,
For he can no more endure
Than did the lucky hero's mother,
Whose soft usue
Aware of her Gilgamesh Lord
Did oh! his life's ditty write.

The hero's fatherless were ever calls
To which his heart was never sent;
Who for long time his virginity
Aware of age and call,
Neither turned his barren head nor single went
But ere the second, and the third, and fourth day,
Went his to come or second man.

His mother in not having both was dumb,
And his brother and his sister long since died;
And so without recourse to her had been
A living tooth, and shield, and counsell thereon,
Or comfits, and such like things that pay
For serving man and ways.

Where was the fair nest of sweet content
Which their sick leas' with joyance did deliver
And the sweet being fed therein?
Where the cheeks' joyance, where the ingenuous face,
Where the glad dears and each lov'd playing child?
Where the gay world's face, where the happy light,
Where the palace of heaven's great building?

A little kingdom loth sighing laid
In eating salt, raying much pain,
Heav'n minded it with anger, and shewed
By her great image what the fault was:
The hundreds slew; the thousands followed, they;
They but an offshoot from one stem, they;

"What was that? say, say!" said then the King:
And there rose a prodigious cry
From the stern Greeks, "Who quell they are, who?"
And the third high holiday they named.
And thou might'st see, if so voyag'd you lookout,
How they madly all on her clamorsta go.

Say "Cease for this," he cried; and "not that!"
And "Prayer," for ever praying God to save
Their navy from ruin; "Progress," holding hard
(Inety to an art thou, God, wert born to mock)
The single egress to Hellespont, they;

The rout that follow'd--"Accursatus," again,
And "KPase," and "PKFA," "Steppatch," and "PKSA,"
While the way was once to probability staked,
'Twas save from that wreck of all confounded,
By the mercy-proud meteor, the God's pretty angel:
Who to the wan sear Cimmerian fixed,
While the fierce sea-beasts, there in the gloom,
Panted and fought, and to the seaweed incline.

And that sight in my soul's nowt, nowt, it was:
And that sound--what it be, I cannot tell,
Where it came, or where it went: but 'twas there,
'Twas this--"I see too," I heard him say, "but I've met

And the mighty sea of his discontent
Knew the rest as well as he, and he knew each
heart's hard storm and its cold stone constant,
And the dim folk of that mirehorse crippled;
And the boundless ocean, which yet he might not clear,
Though he draw hardly on its watery springs, knew him,
And his soul's old salt gusto in it strove
And knew him every one of him.

What marvel, then, this conflicting multitude,
If in one instant they had gone to their combine,
But one impulse made? That minute's in-ring, unqlous

Were not for Death aloneilon bound?
But every one saw, now in one, now in one,

Now on earth, now off a thousand heights one man.

We have camped in a dog-grove

My uncle was seated on her lap,

From the open folds the sunlight sank,

from the bedstead to the headstone

A wall-sheet was often left behind;
for it was known to us that these openings

Were made through the coppery inner earth,
and that of the devil.
I was made to kneel to my uncle's bones
. . .
I could hear my uncle
. . .
Now, between the bones,
I saw an opening in the headstone
. . .
When I saw the opening
I could see that the moon was
There in the empty cave
As I had seen it
On the Lion's paws

That night he did not weep.
I saw his eyes
But he did not weep.
He smoked and he drank

I was learning of Him then
In the old age
Tall and grey
In the smell of air
Between limestone and cobbles

Between the dog-grove
And the charnel-hole.

I took R\/ to the Lacewood Avenue station
To catch the R train to North Avenue
Then I went all the way
I paid them no mind
Who were not necessary
I did what I was brought here to do
And it was to stand in a corner
Allegedly "to see the light of day"
But really, who was I
I wondered no more than any other man
I experience life thus and so I have my answer
Why is it that those who sit on high
Have all the time in the world
I have been taught and I observe
They use their imagination
The natives call it spirit
This is what they do now at Long divided
City of Language Architects and bond traders
A train went by and it went fast to Chicago
A took and I missed it
But I saw the stub ends of it
It bound for Atlantic City
I have been in trade with ancient Greek
An unknown word so has been blundered by
Old Caesar to mean blunt or unmannerly
And it was blundered by
By a native Englishman who was laid
Surprised that a stranger lived in the city

I blundered in blundered my spell
For I meant old Homer can I get an instrument
That will tell me what it all is like
And it is like a coin called the lyre
It is like a lyre but only a twang
To lead the eye of the mind
It is like a lyre but it changes
And it sounds like a story
I told of the old Roman
His withered brain and my Roman
Who merged his wits in mighty Roman
Hues

I see him as a Roman now

And a graffiti sound
On a wall in a jungle
Long before the tongue
Was moved
To conform
With the here and now
Of the here and now
And so I blend his ghost with my ghost
Who are you?
And I am not the ghost
Of a Roman
What is in that wall
And in that jungle
And in that wall
And in that jungle
And in that wall
And in each Roman
What have you done there
And how long have you been there
I do not know
You there?

And you are not the Corinthia

The Traveler in you
And never will be until I die
I am not that

I may not love the which she must not love; 
I may not shame the which she must not shame: 
But lay here every guilty subject's name,
Which shall not havely apply to white and black. 
O, that I were no more!, which phrase
She hath absolutely sovereign in her sight 
*exclusive to sister but held by law
ever more, to herself, than any other's. 
A woman to her beauty is subject
Oft for to voice her pleasures, as she doth now, 
Yet still herself denying, making a
Strong general suppulsion that do bewail 
Oft, in the soft accents of her speech,
Feeble and false delicacies to name;
For, in commendation of that beauty,
A fine desire she may take in all
Which are the messenger and test of love. 
She hath her reason in her beauty squander'd
Angry, whose aching sightfore the morning star,
That hail'd it and protest, thanks for it.
Hath her a sting in her sweetness, such as was
In hue unto Robert Ginond a sting
So pernicious ag'ts the Greeks empaneled?
Astonishing, that such damage should hap
To be introduced in a cay, where faire
And no incontinent blindness to his eye
Was thought by the craftsmen of the temple.
Astonishment and surprise are other thing:
Astonishing may we think, dol'lar to be,
And this high pyramid of her sweetness sent
To the head of the procession, may be thought
There hath not need to wish it liq{a}d
When she sits down by the half-deep well to tea.
Beauty keping her speech with "my fond commands" 
And hearing in mine, desire my heart's lettering,
Yea, be thine eyes peeping there to drink it up. 
Say what brings thee to this well's side,
Mead and wisdom?  What would'st thou thereto?
What art cam'st thou hither?  To forsake
The world for any?  or to stick us there?
No need that thou Shouldst ne'er return.  Say just what bring'st
Thy soul and you therein, to the cup there where,
Happier thou art than thou forgett'st be.
He that comes and lives in youth, and longs
For love, and has a mind most prudent,
May safely love and drink together
And not feel jealous nor die:
For, a' the time that heart can cure
Is in his hands, when his thoughts are guide'd
By a wise head and judgment serious,
And he quits lives and takes a column.
The time that meets us with such anger
Or corner as happens there, is
When we offend'd amorous or courtly
Becomes our daughter, spouse, or son.
When justice does 'round the earth and raves
About our aery chat, and warrants,
Calls fudge and reici and complots,
And vows and bullations for our pain,
Bills for our loss and ours for our fleece.
What then, I bid thee, my mind entertain,

Such mensurable plaints from Celia's tears?
You mistake my feelings, far or narrow,
For Lily's tear for Lily's heart-coursing.
There was a time, when, with Lily and Rose,
I did not know happiness.
There was a time, when storms did move
My thoughts from her to her,
When roses were my royal blue,
And one that did waken on my rest
From Lily's eyes a simple kiss.

One, for my Grace, in rills and entablasts
Of love and happiness, without a charge,
On whom her part (as you to read the events
Of daily life)
Would more than as one lily on the threshold
For one of garlandedhall, didto cleave;
One, for my Grace, in riches of tasteful food
And figure regal, in quiet rooms of art,
In cheerful ardours, where to grow was glory,
In sunshine's rainbow for our souls making,
And in our King's indulgence with his own

purse of gold the sun do what it may,

it can do no wrong, not any,

to the nymphs, the nymphs, the nymphs,
who this glacial shame from on high

bear, a sorrow that does bring

all business of their lips on a stalk,

and with vulture fear of each and every,

in vain name of Numa Pompilius,
so long consort of Proserpina.

How much we bear! How little we deserve!

Yet if we must bear it, let it be

for a praise-worthy cause;
And by your Leave, I will grant my feeble Muse

the little she may have.

The cause I choose is serious: so listen,

anthropuriced Numa Pompilius.

(This statesman-like, he's somewhat of a fool;

he means by "these lands"
he means "these graves.")

We have had too much of your kind rule,

foreign profit is destroying our tribe,

We Americans, in our pride's emphasizing

our own brutal rights,
nay, when we gathered as a people
we forgot our old sense-twisting

refinement of a temper.

And where our big Néerican is,

your bank account swelling,

your gangster Dou the French may say,

our citizens in your group of fools,

are at fault for nothing but our
idleness in bearing

the burden of our people's lust,

and Dou he would say of us: "idle"

is your being idle,
we in our small way" corrupt
our own souls.

This is the case, I hold:

we are cursed with a species

called sap
that never takes pause

but bursts forth gushingly at speed,

and fatal motion of streams

on these green lands
a river of earth
will have to find its outlet,

as rivers of wood.

Had we been better babies,

or born of less wealth,
our names might not have been chosen

for use as barns,
as aperture-things to pierce the ground.

Here the bared places are life:

this air, so quiet,
this nothing, is idleness
—what here is no business

is there, and nothing again is matter.

But you're wrong,
you're reading me too much into it,

as well as you believe the world of space,

the prologue has not begun,
the story is not yet written.

The Remains of Johnny Death are not distracted

by this blithering idiot
in a propitious age to be general

with no knowledge of Folly,
and should not be thought of as fallen

from the annals of thought
though they resemble the characters of those

assassined by history,
spoiled children
with hearts like gameboys,
and thycile-drenched hands like bloody hands.
Were we not wiser, more Christian,
to spread the faith of peace

that we really brought you,
we might have been less desperate

and you might have been spared

that corruption's kiss upon your baptism

that drew us together
as murd'rous elements,
and out of the world's desert
the sap that is your baptism
sending us your spirit.

Your spirit, and that of your mother
and my bravery, and that of a nation

that dares to see what it can do
to a continent,
and to make it if order be no more,

to lay down its arms

to the first fascism,
and to choose hope over fear

as the only weapon against the fear
of a world
that moves with a sinister delight

of malice and of mockery,
scratching the lazy crust

of one kind of despair.

And how could you have stood here
a conqueror
with no arms and still have stood

as here you are now
folded in the halo of defeat

and quiet,
with your foot upon the spoiler and your foot

upon the republican —
and what is this?
angered because I call you dad?

Yes, there is your father, pal,

and your mother, and the mighty nation
he loves to preen and strut

in comical insignia,

but there is no more Gotham in you,
no more naught for him to plunder,

and in a thousand years you'll be ashes

with his bones
tainted by the murder

Lord, to us let those false dreams never have shown

Their sleep was bitter as their death more short,

The blood their wound, and the desire their death.

Lord, for thy people, even the wretched

Thou wouldst not look so narrow-eyed to help;

To ripen thorns thou wouldst fast, and stab them deep;

But now they have lost the faith, the life, and wine;

Their trust was a drum, and their rest a clod,

Whereof in ruin their belly king is heir.

He that in looking back toward her was born

Which with dishonor to her daughter brought

The mother-water for spittle upon her head;

But she, for dread even to so good a thing

Which seemed like so many, me first and last

Upon her looks first smiled, with the hot life

Which the first young cock more merry made,

And the last old one, when 'twas too late.

And three champions against our so great plain:

And as an armed hart he he keeps his pounce;

And Sabr breathing from his country's side,

Is tamer than his feather, and more soft.

We all in this are ours, and so shall be,

If for but three days we shall not be forced to fly,

When these, our fourfold camp shall be forgo:

This new field for less work shall be did,

And all this land to be deserted;

Then may we dwell in open breasts, and rest.

This for two days; then shall be two more,

And thine own life, even from this morn,

Out with the beacon, with a pounding pace,

Fleet as he may, head strong and hight,

The first of our fourfold band, he may

Of work in himself, of civic work,

Sith to all our isle eft he must.

Henceforth for his own, himself, his own life,

He shall not be for more, but let be

As gods do hear the islands of their fair nest,

Gently, not loudly, not as we that be

Unto the stream of it, as them that keep

Their steddiness, their place of guard awar.

Mellifluous, multicultural, for all life,

Their makers of old, their makers be:

So weighed the musicians in the ancient Greeks:

So the harmonious offspring of old Sefolos:

So the citizens of happy Sparta:

So counted the men in those legendary days

To the first to crown the sphinx, the King Lysander.

Lord, for thy sake, so many fulfil
The high behests by kings of doing lowly,
As, trusting heart to the unrrousle hand,
Thou, for the hoping world, hastataened many a day,
Art proud to be the hand thereof,
And for the world thou yearly art beloved.

Then he rous'd the hasty funeral:
A native bark fit for speed,
Quick in all things, to the fire he lent;
And made his horses in the front to ride,
Then th' other two on wings his help bestow'd,
With ev'ry charm a runner still adept,
And, following up, the windy blast beguile,
Their passage thro' th' unctayan way,
The sea as wont, they pass'd it, a surface smooth,

Fancy then had barely made a stay,
For shee far excell'd her pow'r to wake;
The sea was smooth, a fine white sand, of cause too,
Except where some bright fragment of a rock,

This bright fragment of a rock, was always sought,
And first in her wond'ring descent,
Rous'd from a squaw, at fading Quakers wait,
A pruning-sword, a treble chop, a stick or stone,
Then straight to rise again, still near the shell,
Her wonder-steep'd company of stars she took,

And sound abroad, the ocean fresh she shipt,
For one natural hunner did all cheer,
And being near, with vague, inking eyes,
The sea seem'd loving her, and crying salt,
Blessee her! Sweet hair!

Thereat with leaves in a sunne-craft' inglorious,
That still were expected near, she did desist,
And judg'd herself shameful to presume,
And bade curse her scorning and her snare,
And soft say, "Quick, ere ye cold begin,
Aye come we the best and first of thee."

With that the storme a strack hush'd evermore,
Sprinkling her with spray involv'd amain,
And so it remained till the hard of y'are;
The spar was bent and sintered and set again,
Without a rent, and the sea did inter,
And now 'twas the 3500, at the farthest, had she
Approach'd and gazed below, out of her awaes.

Then shuddering through the sludgy pool she run
Into the hollow: with a flocal dulle
The septentrach black did inter, and pin
His entrayde toes on the smoothed pistach rim:
On the ground-up, push'd it under tow'r,
That horn-headed swine: "See" they say,
It make a noise like shell-gamearent.

Thence the silent snail, in his bend fore-feet,
And shorn clumps of bones, and goateering mus
We custodious of in a footpath found ourselves,
Our breathless arrear so aright; our bane,
Our bane, our torments, our choler, our ache have learned,
That is noicht, tout bas guerre.

Cobb complete then ran the casing guant,
That we, as all men knows, but know not where,
Our ring-dowsing from the septentrion to the t;
Saith I, "I will give her such a one
As no comedian is in the house."
"Ah," say I, "I see I cannot flye;
I shall pay full indeed a prease."

Then to my self I will my second case,
That now in you may flow as the first,
And all the paints that woodye in their wounds
May know their torments, know their pain: yet few,
If any, the number will reward.
This Octo luned, and in his brood
Five children lighted words of watery speech,
The most of any, in my threescore years;
That single one in all may give
The disease which waxes woe and death.

'Twas Octo cam' to the place as he drawed
Long ereikins, and then he did ensew'
And then he did eke up with a speckled yilch;
But all his work yonder, that should be a map
Of some world or other men callit OEchalia,
Which most of all a map is of th' unsapeld land,
When all is tried from shore to silver sea,
But this was not all; he could as well, doeth chace
If that by all else were done as well,
And then to the mouths there followed, all of wax,
Which were the tongues of men to the woful backhont
About: for there and there a pen he light

Then will I choose to go to join my own again,
Singing that there's nothing sweeter than a mate.

I sat in the boat,
And she in the lonely boat
Singing and singing,
In the garden of love
By the streams of the E.
O'er the water,
Over the water,
Through the leaves,
Keep always whispering that true love never dies,
That death is only death's emergency,
That affection never ceases to be our rule.

Where the little boat
Gatenallies with oars,
Love wakens fleetory hopes
To drift to the centre
Of the waters he quaffes
In that green vale
Where the oolis are ever singing and straying.

The last stroke she made
In his fortune of life
Was when she brushed his hair
From the crown with a lint-handed finger,
And a lisp of joy
Came from the disorder
Like the crowd that sings and strains
When a new young king is crowned.

Down from a crest
Of plumed thists,
Like a shell Christina steals
Flaura from the mould
To lie like a pearl
In her milky place,
Where her seductive eyes
Keep an angel's face
Awake in every shape.

I asked for magnanimity
From the aspect of my case,
And I got sour and unfull:
Grateful for words at this moment,
I think of the far-off sparrow
Slying near the rock,
Slyly waiting for the shrimp to swim
Out of the fathomless water,
By the long-haired carp that waits
On the margin of the place where we drink.

Ah, but the sparrows of the air,
Chirping, honking shrill,
Chasing rainbows down from the clouds,
Are not richer than I am;
Far more little, yet great;
They never pass Gaza over;
If they did, it should be every man
And every woman born of her.

                              Many human lives
We waste in wasted passions, we lose in men and wine.
What is Banker's Window but a panes
With laths, then, fall down, when we remember well,
The man who wanted nor hammer-struck stones,
Nor any design of streets between market-square
And sky, nor yet extended to unicentre
Of cathedral, nor to vertuct
Of bridges, nor to marde lined with pines
Over bubbling cisghnale, nor build a town
Warm with store of water, nor open
Veneer at central aqueduct, nor dis-
cyle the grvert uglcious sand from marble turned
Into her metal? He would have bought rather
A window, if he had had one, rather.
Well now he sits human, with his pride
Letting board, and hanging eggs to crack them, too;
But if he had sat as the goose warden does,
His cum-cutters, with their film of blue,
Be absolutely sure that the poor cawings
Of birds find not the good road, whate'er
They be, but crows, and even the convenient
Fliers, stars, moths, are above those weirs
That have in common the upper run,
And drave his epitaph rather low.
For so they were worth the weeping,
And so they were worth the carping too:
The sorrow they rested, the poring good.
And from such to-morrow we shall not be
Down in the deep themselves, as well
As the soft-curling tear-drops; such a friend
As a worm, a fly, can teach out no more
In this high buzzidigs of the human world,
Then let one read, or one write, and one weep,

That answers, and no strings have touched;
If a farthing is the sum of his gain,

She became a wanton girl, and therefore girl
Too dear for sale, then pulled down,

All this is real; but you, who
Are an Eastern beasemen, and sat
Ill-temper'd, satisfied with just
Vranium of Faith, and with a thread
Of Mohammedanism weaving
With his holy law, must needs
Endure, because he is not provable.
He knows that you are blind, and will
Ignorance what he has told you, and reject
Vulgar errors, given to you by the Law
As to the moon and celibate clergy.
The former you can forget or charm, but
Celibacy is beyond your poise; and from it
No small, though gentle, illusion has been plann'd
On your youthful, gay, but sovereign mind,
As boy, yet man; as mature, yet still boy,
In virgin-begins not yet broken. Yet grow
Good when God gives none, sexual begetting

As apples of their size cause fruit unsought,
These errors of a by-past, though bred in you
With as much hate as yourself, will now,
Being by births of a rig in them, your sorceries.
But I have sowr'd, and enderd, with my spare care,
To plant again from ploughshares. Still, boy, go on,
Till vof these straits, which calls me up,
Point out thy manhood, if I here find
You have no yet unsown in you. I have now
More rights in you than if NORICE had not sinnd,
And all her sonople, all; for who then will be
Sorry that he is; nor will I then underage
Mistake my reckoning! but my point is this,
That Love to know how much a manness is
 Worthiness splendidly to fill,
If I mean to exalt me--this for a woman
Is worth extolling! Thou, my son, more sure
To grow, if, true to childhood, thou keep'st free
From all these, and other temptations,
From the efnort way, from honour, from these streets,
From all deceit, secrets, sins, from allull
Blood, with which we are at this hour
Bred, which leads straight to slavery; from
Desire of gold,arel, and lavishment
Of the soiebiant or handsome fall'n in life,
To leisuration and opinion,
Entail'd in those three:--For in these werkes,
Which wttl arise, he abroad desired,
He must first satisfy his craving eye,
Ere to acquaintance made; what relationship
Can be between these and full knowledge,
But contact? which by familiarity more made,
For envie, can we not with like approvation
Seek and know you also? besides, whose thynge,
If not approv'd, hongs ufd as devyte,
And heedles calls more feyt then it deserve;
Of thyrsis no doubt it is but amort,
To sene brotherhermtit heart, but time
Hath trusst it so. With this purpose now
Of knowledge initiated, and truth can reach,
Compar'd with which the neghborly poort is frittered
In the removd, gife vntended on the ruthe,
And dead as in a brood confort,
Which by dissembling seems hong te him
Till pluckt from him as from their centre;
Which hee, surety, in his rectitude
Cares nought of, but as to end he fritter,
Such neer was the thing set in his hart
Tis life; and to the full all his hart
Canst graft, before this, wandreth in woe.
Such brass will stain a child, such wood corrupt
Adam, dust will mold Enoch, and as low

Ne're otherwise with man, for since he
The garden was unfulled, lost
All nature that was in him while
By just committal, and presently
This venereal, weak self-drinker
Powder-constraining spirit, banished hence
To tabernacle of self-restraining inebriety,
Thence arises such a generation.

Their little small heads to an even tune,
With a tiny touch,

After awhile the crowded room
Curled round the head-rattling radio,
But just as suddenly
At the other end rose a voice
And a laugh by an autograph
Clearer than ever
Quick o'er the throng,
And a single line:--
Why I am glad that I live

Here's a master's path,
Where the birds are free
To the not too distant sun;
But the nature of the land
All doth banish Bath from her list.
The little river eternally
Streams and spirals by the inn.
And the houses, close together,
T to e o' the radio
Are two caves beside.
The radio show is up at high
Impound the other way.

All wild-flowered pastures
With gardens full of
Stript trees, old farm houses,
Close as we love our very
Listless homes everywhere,
Bath is not on the cliff.
The little noisy machines
Seem to confuse
With living watermats.

Houses with rent-periods
To a year or two,
Sit the weary bent-st where
Scrub-grass in the lawn mow
Bristle as it kills the mower,
And j. date-pink, with its white
Upsprings instead of chinos;
While the road is grown-up
And Persiforion's
Plus three extra large car
O'erlooks with a magnolia.
'T is true that though
It is well-spoken
Chisel-lips tell the news
Easy and plain,
Still you ask
How good it feels
To be Sally?

Pensil, aside
Lao-li bid good-luck
To all men,
Took his truck;
On a windy day gone
Sat outside
With the newspaper
Up his nose,
Thinking of Sally,
On his perch,
Thinking of Sally,
And a dozen things
Other than

When to go down the hall
At three,
I think of the door
And Sally
And think of him
As a young man
Going somewhere,
Going away
To speak to Sally;
Doing for Sally
What we do
For God's Sake.
Then of three
Who'd have thought
By Ma and Marie
That he was taken
Home with Sally
To be shown to his
Little girl

And not
Died in the war
Of the newspaper
War
Scoring a single coin
In the total
Disaster?
In the real sense

Ah yes, it scratches
The head
I am clear
How he saw Sally
To Montreal
Last spring.
But Sally
Not Sally.
What a strike!
The star turned pale
When it seemed
To buzz around
The word
The star
Did not know
Meanly.
It goes without
Using the word

How many are there?
How many, me young host?
There are many, me young host.
As many as the bees
Or some are to sample
The honey.
You are not happy, young host?
You would rather
Go out in the cold?
I can not blame you, young host.
You would rather
Watch a sheep-handling
Or prink
In the sun.
The room is plain
And the indoor room
Would be more your style.
So the plain room you may
Be satisfied.
So the indoor room,

But I tell you, my young host,
There is a much better way.
Handy it is to show
These peevish things
The first and the last.
What can be done with them?
You would rather
Smell the sugar bunches
Under your ranket spot.

In winter the way
To make
======================================== SAMPLE 381 ========================================
 trade will not fall by such a blow;
And we can find as good an estate
As we used to make with liquor at night.

Dost you love the master of the horse
That bore you in the battles of the west?
Dost you love the master of the man
Who saved you, when the waters were deep?
Dost love the master of the wife
Who feels her soul in every fibre?

Dost love the man who parted you
When life felt very thorny,
The sullen way?--and did he fail
In his great duty, and was there naught
That he could have done, that he could believe?

Dost thou love the toil of the year
That darkened forests put under,
O'er which the whirlwind blew its fire,
That the somber clouds were chosen,
O'er which the snow and blinding -
The snows of heaven were strewn?

Dost thou love the storm that cowed you
O'er the sea that lay in rest?
O, was there need to question so,
About the man who cries at night
That he would surely perish on
If better had taught his heart
To tremble with doubts no more?

I love thee, if love can do so,
O, the proud boast of youth's conquest,
The great dream that life summed up in one made;
I love thee, I love thee, if
Thy heart be where fury is,
And if one longs, yet cares the more;
For thou with my soul art mixed.

I love thee, if love can see
That glancing water between us two,
I hope, and you above, and make believe;
I love to see the day in thee rising,
And into my life raining every day.

There's vanity in the low, grovelled eyes
That make it easy to turn out friends;
There's life in the quick, wistful breath that breathes
Between us two, the need makes fain;
But oh, I love because it is fair,
And you to please believe that you don't fall;
Because you believe in full is paid
The debt that you ever owe to me.

'Twas just the spring time, and summer beautiful,
And flowers full-blown before their summer wastes;
A violet, the earliest, on the lime-bough lined,
And a tulip incomparable sweet,
That, versus, war had won with a purple stripe
On a white ground. Ay, its bright sides made such a haze
That light from the sun seemed locked, and e'en the breeze
Puffing out its box of berry-scented hairs.
The chirping birds, the lumbering breeze, all thought
They had been dreaming of something that clear
Had been all this shopping in the world around.
All loves were declared, and declared in song,
As 'twere again made; who said what he/she knew,
And said what they would name, and Tinday said not a word.

The love that lifts up its eyes to Heaven at night
Is not so very tender that it not betray
The surmise of a man who would be wed
To its own hidden smell of emerald taint,
White of the mere, and green of the tree,
Green of the gloam, blue of the feet--say, what is it?
Love that walks on the nethermost places?
Oh, something there is triumphing, vindicating,
Knows no more of jail and chain than a hammer,
Spends no money on the fielighting of black and blue,
Than a man with a goal which he/she should touch.
Love that knows no risk and threatens no delay,
Thinking no evil of the Spirit of Man made,
Hath, with a wild-bird in a tinsel cape
(A gold banner with a golden ecru collar)
Watched the labyrinth of the world as a rat
Dilating toward Heaven, the sun, till the mind
Of the world, made of pure and broken atoms,
Could not follow, even though the motion made
An evildoer out of the morally right,
With a might that was equal to the literally wrong.

Yea, there were some that were right all the time,
And so was the uniformity of their lives;
And some who were so right all the time
It seemed that they would not wrong nor save a thing,
But just went on as their budget told them they should,
Going on as their right mind told them to.

I went about my business as I do every day,
Visiting rooms I wasn't

her re-birth the universe is I say
The Gorgon's mother, Nausicaa, saw
him lying in the sand, and with her teeth

bit down
his neck. This is what she told the Argonid, son
of Polybus, but men muttering behind her, who was in
meantime for a sword to cut his throat.

Or as a bird, when her feathers are scattered, and one
goes down to find them, but as soon as she has found
them, another comes and gets them, the first one sees
them scattered and breaking into pieces, and sits
up, but when there's another comes and gets them, the first one
comes and gets them, the first one says, "What shall I do? I saw the
dentures on the ground, where I left them, but these are not so nice;
now I see, my dear, that I said them on the ground they are
not so nice. I shall never get them all, one will jest foul,
and then again elsewise."

Such was the chief whose head had been broken by that beast God
with the Blood-stained Neck, inasmuch as he governed it as a faimmas
priori, for that he was ferocious in his mood. And here
died he, of head so torn with terror, after he flays their throats.
Aruns, the son of Epiphanios, next strove his strength
in undertaking others; and from him and the other
slayers were the large portions of their acts.

From this passage of the Theban goddess, to the
disgraced and estranged Argive people, and the
angry host of Rhesus, who were seeking that quarter
they might bring to reward their wild warfare, an angel descended
with the voice of Revelation, and stood on Mount
Corosetum looking over that passage of the forest, and
uttering the prophet's name that should stand for prophet
to the whole earth.  Well and durable did not a silence
divine prevail, nor a silence supernatural. It
answered both to the men of renown, and also to all
who on that side looked toward the starry choirs above,
which Jesus Christ, his head sheltered with finish and helmed
and with his arms raised up in claiming the glory, his
face visible to beholder to be the picture
of the Naiads that might be seen to manage that thicket, and
that, as it seemed, the inspirational and incarnate Word of God,
who had the dignity of a Benzier, courted the esteem of
Lesioned by their language and inclosed in human form,
they will be found, when we catalogue, by
velocity, nature's most mysterious branches; and Taemra's
people, and natives of a damp region,--nights at
chance, will satisfy your need of ease, and delight, and
content you above all human aime. And who likes the
lows of the law, or who enjoys them well, anywhere, will bring him

districts, and his sagas, will be found. And he who made
without a precedent the Ebor-heights, and the Skaghtoghegans, and
people that cultivate the plain, will at no time find a
ground. For that a birth has no cause where of itself are
counts as human ancestry; and that is how refined man, one
fault and mistake though he be, can collopy and outlive the
feet from bare earth: so that human nature from the
`Form in fault, in kindness, not in fault of Form' has set in
respect to order.

Now the fate of the universe from its birth, from the
glass wasopy edition, from the death of Manu beyond the
caphereon, down to the Ebor and Elroys of France, has
deterred or superseded. Now generation and death of
man are not reckoned of any cost, though in either case it
happened that an adder th Proteus it is, is avoided. And the
misery and paupercreme of the flesh are done. In the
shrubbed state we are clothed with eleven. And generation and

pathway of fleshly sense; and since sense is the
grip of life no less than sense, what may the pain be of
Pysic men in Sunland, or of animal Amaru in the
same <zi-nlz>? The amaranths another code of names uses

There are <zi-jezz> that seek shade, but there are those that

I'M--ever
astounded
to see how, by  telling it
out loud like that,
somehow, this sky

haggering, with nudge and prod,
and why it shouldn't

the grim attraction of

But--there it goes on
grimlier still!
And why not?  Why not?
It's the world, after all!
The most inexorable world

not one of us would get?

"The Love That Is Not", by David Baker [Love, Classic Love, Relationships, Men & Women]
I have no desire
other than to be desired,

the moon to the sun,

the morning to midday,

the noon to the evening,

the evening to the morning,

the silence to the music,

the evening to the noon,

the love that is not to be departed

other than to say of a was,

other than to say joy,

the happy past, the painful present,

the uncertain future,

the bitter toil, the fortunate

chance to be loved,
the happiest love that is not.

"I Heard in the Air", by David Baker [Social Commentaries, Cities & Urban Life]
I heard in the airThe plane was on fire and falling—

a woman's voice, like in a dream.

I saw in the airThe plane was on fire and falling—

a man's voice, like in a dream.

I walked along the burning highway—

a man's voice, like in a dream.

The man said just this and air was full of smoke—

the man's voice, like in a dream.

He carried a huge satchel on his shoulder

full of bread and meat.

His companions watched

as he scattered the bread and meat

all over the city

and even left it outside the house

while they slept.

I heard in the airThe plane is on fire and falling—

the woman's voice, like in a dream.

The man's satchel was big enough

to hold all of his dreams—

the sun came out and the woman's voice, like in a dream.

I walked along the burning highway dreaming

of bombs and cities bombed—

the man's voice, like in a dream.

The city is totally destroyed,

some windows boarded,

the metal grill covered with grass.

The man said "This is Hell" and "Anna" and dreaming

of being held so hard.

Hell is stupid and stupid is not.

Anna is dreaming about her dream.

He said "This is my dream" and dreams about being chased

and lost.

And burning buses and apartment buildings,

he said "This is Hell" and "Anna" and dreaming

of years before this one.

Years ago, before this dream.

He said "Tonight I want to go home."

It's hard to be decided,

to have home and wants,

to decide to go out, to travel,

to go home.

And the air shakes and listens,

like when you try to call home

and your voice is dead.

He stayed out late listening.

He stopped playing the game,

and the ball dropped in the air.

The man said "I heard something" and "I saw it"

and "the sky" and "the light."

He said "It's either this place" and "This home"

and "our game" and "home."

"Incident", by David Baker [Activities, Travels & Journeys, Arts & Sciences, Architecture & Design, Social Commentaries, History & Politics, War & Conflict]
Our cargo ship's departure from Accotink—

Caps are rolled back, delaying the trip—.

Our cabins are ready, as always, with
western lights and guns.

And now the Bosphorus dabbles, takes on some erosion.

Its northern stretch is frozen up, but it surpasses
======================================== SAMPLE 385 ========================================
Groping for a friend, in truth!
I would, that ye could win a friend
From the most fearful pen of fear,
To the sword a sister;
And of those who a sister sought
A lover, and found cruel use of her--
I would, that ye could gain a brother
From the most dreadful pen of cruelty!

Then, by the bearing of the Northern snow,
And the loneliness of arid drouth,
And the shine of torches in the nighttime display,
And the scent of infantry in the morning light,
And the thirst, that is the sign of freedom for me,
I salute thee, Country of Mother and of Medusa!
I stand between thy sea and the seethingaf
Sea-meadows of Freedom waiting for a grave.

By the sound of ancient harp, by the rushing of reek,
By the fog-smoke thick at the entrance of the bore,
Up from the sloughs of vessels, or from the wrecks,
Look we and look we forward to a day
, of a final shout, to the level mud,
Which the boots of man never stomped!

The horse of man, so run from our maker,
For a thousand years and more,
Has covered not even the first day
Of a hair's-face in his work;
He tells no stories, he takes no notes,
He counts no days.

But we, the things, bepears a-yearning
For all the sorrows he hath known,
Rejoice, and hope, and daily smile,
And long for the day when he can speak,
Speak for us his word thro' a grave.

Yes, the old horse of the world,
Of the creator known,
We, yt know, are prone to guess at bis life,
And to pine for a could do more,
For the mercy he showed ere our need,
For the pleasure he hath shown.

Yes, the horse of the world knows
That his life is not meant;
We, the creatures, need his green grass whelp
Even more than he the pig,
He is happy sitting on an engin green,
While we are pestered by sun and rain,
While we fret and ask for bread.

There's not much hope for resurrection
Our fellow, in the thirties.
But there's a rider now, to spoil
The world with a beetle,
And this beetle's story to come see,--
If there be truth in the legends,
Which I doubt,--

When he awoke, he staggered
For the dark, whereat he fell.
Renawed, indeed, but he was up,
And through the dark he swung.
Yet from the wreck of his firmament,
Things, shadows, he gathered,
Falling things none identified,
Most spastic and twisted in form,
And some that he tossed about

When I was brought up,
I seldom if ever saw the sun.
As oft as I have cryoneaph,
As errands to do,
And have my prayer to the Just Soul
That reigning Still
Shall lead us on the right.

What, pray you,
Shall I do, or may,
Whanout me my Wish shall ask,
But the perpetual thanks of the grateful sky
That made the old moon in the shade?
Ask anything, then,
Happy as nowinces,

Ask fortune,--
I'll confess
I have had my refusal,
And never cared for moons,
But for pleasures's likeness,
And why?--
Because the lilac are sweet to me
With their poet-protectress,
And nobody else--like bees--
Can sing to give so much solace.

And on the camel,
Gross with beauty and youth,
I've seen the seven heavens
And met with the seven his hand,
To whom I answer:
"From heaven--you all are twins;
But we are not in the world;
And you'll come to me!

"I am the image of beauty
Disciples of creation
The dying artist sets his seal
On what is above and round,
The womb, the apple, the leaf;
The gentle circle of creation,
The magic circle of making,
Wherein the magic things grow;
I am the image of creation,
And my form is harmony."

The wind went sifting
Down through the rippling
Wedge of the morning;
The neighbors
Gathered and stared
Like they'd see a ghost;
Like they'd see a ghost,
For he was blowing
Home along the way,
Full of beautiful wonder.


======================================== SAMPLE 386 ========================================

Is not a week old
Mothers her
In her arms!
A kissing with him in it.
In cold wet days
My mother is so kind to me.
That
Dries the moon to the moon's half-bred stars,
And makes my heart so wild for her,
That, when you see
Once dimpled and dimpled and dewy-pipped

In those deep gentle sweetnesses' embrace,
It's as if a big black satin kiss
Had met in the rumpled mane

And tied it there, and taken a loving strain
And woven it into the mane of thy face.

A jealous sister stole us away to the park
To exercise her modern-bred snath with thee.
O, Jealous, what art thou? Thou art not
The first, but the god-breed mother.  In vain, said I,
I have bred one like; I pray her for her sake.

My boy, I know
Thou hast learned to be prouder, true, but she has not affected
Such thinkings as a wicked wife ought ever to take
Ever.  This woman is not worth a gilded sleighing look,
It is thy virtuous nature that makes thee superior.

How beautiful thy rilibles!  How close thy iambe for ever toiling
To keep thy trunk rooted to the firm earth!  When the mist
Breathes forth upon the peak, thou dost repello-blaspheiThy fulness; the plants curl themselves irresast
To shake themselves into graceful apopleys.  How hast thou done
These things well?  My boy, it's no use inquiring
More: thou hast no airs about thee.  That were not so good wasting
Tin'ur; art thou a poet?  It ministers with a false
 And false grandeur to the talents of a bard.  Thou art
Unworthy of thy namesake.  Take wfrom me thine honorable title.

I'm not so good
Making times,
As some think,
But I'll front the issue;
If I'm forced to say I'm defeated,
It would depress my moody mood.
Facing facts,
There's too much killing and killing.

The lords of the matter
Know best their mischance.
They'd best let me face
What's good, right and proper,
If killing never troubled them:
And they've no secrets dreadful,
None to spare or risk distress
In this red pandorum of the State.

Yea, there, now you see,
The state hath its uses.
Besides, why supercilious are gentlemen
In conquering new realms?  A fool is what they call us,
Who, through inexperience, presume
Things which cannot be achieved in today's world.
'Tis all vain; and should they be wise
They ne'er would want.
If ruin'd, they can get you a rich indulgence;
So that your share of death sends you straight to heaven.
They think that you're losers if you decline this prodigies,
And always are forced to conquer out of turn;
While to see your pleasures prodigal
Made it a story, and your neighbours' blessings neglect.
But this, my child, my obediently-guest daughter Blanche--
'Tis only a firefly's bragging, your good daughter Blanche--
The firefly's brag, your duly sworn, good daughter Blanche.

The law, you say, that controls our land,
Guarded for the neighbourhood of just one poor damned man.
And now, without your licence or help, your lord and king
Have gone to Africa to round some lazy buckhorn towns.
Fair interference of the said law, said we, king:
Who o'ertinks his belly full of meat and drink.
Nay, fair copartner; but who shall guarantee
The poor man?  Or your pros, our law, said king:
I'm sure, 'tis this, or the said law
Sually tempers, perverts, protects
Your proper name, captain, corporation.
Tho' some pretend to equality,
This will go round as far as 'tis best for the bean.
But, fair mouth, so sweet life's achievement,
Your proper diet, say I, must first, like hay,
Then temperance measures by exports or imports.

In sulky industry let sloth have rest,
Cigarettes, cheese, and ginger-pop
For the froward life of the workingman,
And, lastly, whisky or brandy, to make
His life full addition of gruelling penalties.
======================================== SAMPLE 387 ========================================

Just to see him and then leave him be my first duty!

The thing I'd do, don't you know, Nell,
When you got in the habit
Of asking men to play you a few rounds
Of cribbage--just to keep your mind off--
You know,--the Things Girls are Ambitious To Do!
When you had just began to learn the art
Of beating up your little sail-wagon, Nelly,
And one day brought home a letter to let you
Know I was not unc impressed with your style of dress,
I said to you,--"You're the man, for Heaven's sake!"
But to cut you short, for heaven's sake,
I'd have you come and take the fault back half, Kay?
I did not say it lightly, did I?
I think I meant it rather chiefly, Nell!
But who'll prove me wrong? Let's try and now, Kay!

The breakfast satelite, Nelly,
Just dropped her a hint as we sat,
A tender little miss, not a week old--
A baby it was, a wee suck-at-the-face,
Neat little head, the kind that rides America's Way.

You never did get him to say, did you, Nell,
What was he doing here? Or is he one of those
That whistles green and says nothings to his planes?
And then when asked where he was he-sittin'
Did he and his green head look half as stupid?

Oh, pity when you're younger,
The baby then, was wearin' of baby-time,
And the mother came on a time or so
And was pretty sore that you didn't know
Your dustin' me! For you know
That was a long, long time ago.

I'd change it easy too if I could hit
On some idea which would please me more
Each time 'I borrowed' it from you,
But somehow, I don't think I'll any time soon.--
This is probably wrong, and I should hope
You'll care to hear it isn't no secret.

Dear, it's very hard, when you're grown,
So very hard, but what's another way
When Love is such a coward, and the gates
Of Paradise disguised enough
As her sweet threescore for the market-cross,
The ten-cent shoe! You've got to laugh,
My dear, though, to make the cut--and you
Don't know--it can't be put by!

When I was appointed at your age
To so much work that you have actually
More or less been laid on your back
Than with just one half of your heart,
And the raising market takes so long
And is so erratic, and the work
So on-and-overdiffident, you see
How subject to being gave your own:
Don't fool yourself it's a step or fall
And that this is Love, or too late
A Pnd-hal thing (though Pndals are rare),
Or that the only thing Love does

Not the best one;--it's a maiden fancy
That has anointed head and heart
To a Heaven in which we're too slyly slippin',
There in our two-page fabric swimming
Together, you and I, Nelle Jure!
Not the best one, though, the meeting
Of lips and whisperin' not the workshop
'At sixteen from home in the world's whyrea mouf,
'Alone together--and that's enough--
Not the best one--the meeting of minds
In a cellar, and Love 'at fallin'
From out a meat-rack, all fattenin' slumber!

But the cellar 'with its holds so natural,
And the base of a hand-dug cellar low
Where miracles is a favourite option,
And glam-folk--you'd believe it or not credee--
Playin' a duught known as a ditty;
In the groins of the floor it gets more--
Playin' cards a-pewpees 'em a bit sloe --
Pox Popes and soda chambers--
The life o' the place is a nerve-player--

You say: And the deets notch me, Nell?
I'll not be specific, I'll leave that--
'Tis something like that, or something like
Its shadows fleeces in the sun-light,
Tempts me back with a taste of its sweetness--
Tricks my nerves a trifler, I can see--
But it's nixons pleasin's the piano-

 northward toward the stern of the black ship.
We sought the spot, and soon my laboring heart
Beheld a sea; the silence of death, the grave;
The hush of black water, the mystery of night;
The fear of rocks and slips; the fear of apprehension;
The vain attempt to find a path that might hold us all;
The wind that drove the searching lantern, the fog that rent
Our blessings, the lie of water, the stars that burned,
The blind guides, the haste, the losing voice that cried, No!

"There was the port, the fog, the stars, the wet wind, the wake of ships;
We saw the brine-spray on the far, thin-walled sea; we heard
The faint sea-sound, faint lightnings, the West minstrels say.
No dying voice of living men, no mariner's voice,
No cry of danger, no pain of peril, no dying shriek,
We saw it all, and wondered; but we had not seen
So much of earth, and knew no world's transparency.
No earth's deserts bare; no man-made port unwalled;
No pathway for the guide-books; no blueprint of man.
We neared the last; a ghostly chain-long port Cymotho
Perceived and lost.  On we plumbed; in our bill of fare
A caravan of states, of burdenless freedom's iron men
Trailed in the shells of slaves, our rulers; the clay
Of our becoming clay less, less, with each fresh hour;
On we rolled, past marina, past subaqueous bar,
Intrusted deep with Freedom's black gravely, that shall live
To carry tale on palms of prayer.

"No eye shall see, no eye shall see it even as we,
No ear shall hear it, and no ear shall hear it at all.
Mind shall go out bare, mind going at its back,
Counting the echoes, harbouring thus her unspoken fear
Of the unknown commanding column, big with dread
Too big with dread, and God at its head unaware,
The unknown commanding commander."

All is odd and frightful and strange
Now my unsteady feet press
The slimy snail where it ticks,
The water-sliding fish that take
The shadow of the water-snake
And sting of mine,
Sealing its point from sight.

The sun on the water-toned noon
Stretches out length'o width;
No breath marks the line of gray;
The wind has an edge
From off the glimmering deeps.

Thro rill and marster's knee
The path to heaven that I'm headed
Is dusky, a corpse-like red;
Thro bank and plain I'm worn,
And now the chill of the sink
Lies to my heart in the gloom.

To my swelling heart's content
I a secret admire;
For water-spirits are there,
And one to my fancy rare;
Secret I suppose, and true--
I think of them often.

Yet the song of the water-bell
Meets me then; and from above
A voice of dove or eagle;
Till heart to heart with comfort swells,
And faith that airy mind
Strikes in my breast of bone.

As my vision, fed, extends,
Thro night I 'scuse the day,
Though the unseen stars not light,
Though moons not lend their light--
I blindly fancy not.

Tho' weary hope long down forsook,
When first the bite came, still she spoke
Of when no springforth shalt thou see:
Some day that day.
Still she spoke, and now could tell
If we were here to stay or no.

I grew proud; spoke to her of deeds
My bitter, long pain had brought;
Nor yet forgot the castle, where
I lay beneath the watch tower,
Amang the other great bridges lived.
Ah, if the birds should say,
"Here, lives Good Cole," and I, that am

In dream, to-day, when lift I
The scorpion uprising
From out its bed, wait, sweeter,
Than love's own Zrack off yon star!
Let me hear their prayers, white and bold,
At counting-on, like the swans,
On the river of Cambria!

I strewed the floor of the Ferry-house;
The tramp of the teamsters ceased;
And a presence, stark and sober,
It was, beyond a doubt, a mistress,
A return for

With all this talk of God and country and brown people
Why not name the weekend the "Sunday ofSin!"
And the rise, sweet easy rise, of everything bad:
The hog-gerking weather, the sty-ject kind
Of vapid love affairs and penis-size questions
(We all have genitals size-five or six,
But which to choose with—balls to sex or neato wedges?).
Or the other way round, the "Sunday of Sin"
Whereto women sell their souls and men their swords
To indulge the palate and pursue the dream
Of total pleasure in a gradual slow dinner,
Where eyes draw cock-drawing long-deceived looks
From rose-flushed dumps and other sweet times prayed
Over and over, until the pigs are well cooked,
And the wine-dark-bumpers wired are bright.

"Litany", by Thomas Merton [Love, Desire, Heartache & Failure, Viscosity in Life]
The heart, till now a solitary thing
Of light involvement only, she moved all night
Until she dwelt with her so passionate and strong
It seemed as if God's love had been divided strong and free
And their passion had been the one and the other,
And her soul's the LOT. She had been so fast and blind
Defiled, defiled, her blind and naked heart
In the posture of ecstasy. Now all night
Night and solitude and the deep commitment
Of spirits, and the niggard endear-
ure of pleasure, were hers. She slept. She dreamt.
She was SINGED.
She was groomed, garlanded,
Prentice, with tools, with tools,
Working, working, working, grooming, garlanding,
With a whip and my belts and cables
She was groomed, being held
On her nimble body by the only bonds
She loved, being the strongest, best o' the hoo-huns
And agile of pack-hunters, with the tools
In the skillful hands of a master grasper
And a bridegroom bottle-man
She was groomed, being held
By the tools of a master grasper, groomed
By the marriage pomps, by the marriage bands
Of all that was perfect in love and sights
On this life called historical, in the visions
Of a marriage ceremony
She was groomed, being held
By the tools of a marriage pompsman
And a bridegroom bottle-man.

as well as at the others. In youth, he is often described as handsome, intelligent, and pious;
and yet one reads of many other things as well, in fact I have shown,
and in some of his private letters one discovers much of interest which is spoilt
by the running commentary. He was the favourite, as we may well believe, of his father,
from whom he received a zeal for natural science and for metaphysics, which the
old biographers have spoilt him in, by maintaining that he knew of far-fetch'd paths to
heaven which his younger brother pursued; and it is a pity that we are not
to be diverted by the quantity with which the old riddles are undid,
for they have cut out a second part, with which they begirt each following

I hurt thee because that I truth know not, nor can amaze
into thinking that there can be others beside one piece of clay
whose relate'd qualities are more perishable than my own;
And yet for many such, if they have not been wounded,

I hurt thee that I thought thee eternal and then saw
that thou hadstfound that thou was indeed a man;
and I hurt thee that I thought thou stereotypest rites to which a man
has held the strictest discipline; and I will hurt thee more
with another sort, by thinking that thou art of no more use to
 thyself than means in which is no use to anything:
and I would not have thee offend, with a love, that is a
traitor, towards me, who have to love thee as my own.

with a weary eye, their councils to see them walk through park,
or go to vote in May on the shallowest of all possible ponds,

and it is not well, when like this man there falls a flood, to leave
passive on himself, and to lay pressure on the more PHYSICAL, which

Of going back to an old-fashioned shoe store
In a sleepy town in upcountry Georgia.
The signs of its sitets, and mossy wall;
The windows filled with dead-marsh shins
And other strange things of that nature,
Gathered from off the backs of travelers
And people far out in low-lying lands
Where things are seldom if ever still.
And, as I wandered in, the shop person
Saw me with puzzlement, like he were a fool,
And asked me, wondering my feet were young.
So glad I was to have any shoes, I said,
Where I could be in them, any old way.

His cheeks glowed like a forest in August.
He thought a long, long time, and then said,
"You want them old-fashioned, long-curtained things
Out of style now--hiking about.
Down in your country you will see
People shoeless and people sandal-hung.
You are provided with shoes all the rest,
In which your foot can lie and not bother it."

A dozen other people staring thought I,
And one or two sneezed and wrung their hands,
And looked at me as if they had a bone.
"Get out," he said. "They are not provided."
And one, looking at his watch, said "Only one more."
"Can't you get out of the street," I said.
"You can," he said. "But you don't want them."

Then he said, "Come along and stand aside
While I fill these slippers to the brim.
You see these lasts? this pair of shoes?
They are not good on the feet at all."
"Then I will get them set with care
From the bar that has them all to sell."

He took my hand I hadn't noticed before
And--told me to stand? "These lasts
Will set your feet up straight."
He took the shoes from off the floor
And set them at an angle tall,
From the tallest part of the wall,
Right down to the tallest part of me.

And then, he slotted on extra length
Of lining and of neckband too,
And, at the heel, he laid the sole,
And, there, he said to me "Be sure
The toes are touching, any way,
So there!" he looked down at me and laughed.

He wrung the sole and set

The people weeping, wondering and afraid
Who this might be?
Who this could be?
This is the place where no one had ever been.
This is the solitude in which they had first known
The darkness and the sound and the stink of the sea.

That was the night in which we lived together,
And that was the night we fell in with grief,
And that was the night when first I knelt and prayed
And read the trouble into the heart of me.
That night in which I kissed your hands for the first
Time and went through all the changes of my life.

I am the younger. I have the light, the hope and
The terror of life. You have the passion too,
The utter ardour of being in love.
I must bow to that necessity which is man's;
And leave the striving and the sweat of thought
To her, the better, more gentle and quieter love.

I should have been choking on a clod of mud
Instead of praising your handsome mind
Where I could say and do as I please.
Now, dame, I give you back your vows
Flapping happily on a tree.
I am the older, better lover.
That was the night in which we lived together,
Before I felt the scornful askon,
And saw through a haze the brilliance of the light
That sealed our doom, and said over the wall
To the one who broke the silence--"We doom them both!"
<|endoftext|>

The grass is growing green.
I walk alone through all the place.
I have red gold in my lap bars
Throwing shadows about me
And bringing to me a wonderful calm.
Oh, I am glad I lived
When I did to death's weird moon:
Then I saw you, now I see
Sweet beautiful face in your shoeshine--
Feathered red--feet are gold,
And your blue eyes are blue again.

I break the green grass and watch you.
I feel you up from my knees
And hear you make a sound,
And see your little side-tail wisp

How I heard the roll
Of your frail little wheels
As you came rolling through the grass
My little side-tail skittering there;
I picked up a big wheeled one
From the road, and one at my feet
(Lost as in a dream)
I had both shoes and tights
Both dry and slick as butter.

I have searched all the building
For the room that suits you best.
I bought the little rooms
Forts of a hand-built cat.
In such a room my love
Might lie cushionless,
And stay windless, couchless couchless, there.

There's plenty of room. I tell you
All this, and sing.
You drive home in the night?
Why, it may be
(As my dead do when they're dead)
They care for leave
At night, for play, deep play.
They take the room like precious wine.

In my dream you came--
You, and me, and friend;
Ah, friend was unkind.
I waited there for you
And kissed the room
And kissed the wall
And suddenly: "No."
My dog and I, we wonder
How the two will beat
And take your synonym
How the dead and I--
The little little living fool--
Set the room to cry,
And leave it done.

Hands away, hands away,
Children, children, sleep well in my arms,
Oh, child at rest there in my golden chest,
Child, you may wake in the dawn, I may cry.
Hands away, hands away,
I, I am afraid
As you do cry,
We lose our breath, we lose our breath,
In the rise and the spread of the star of the sun.

Blossom where there was blow
Dust where there was no blow,
Song where there was no song,
Sorrow where there was none,
Strange, vague things where there were none,
Calm was the face
And the way there.

There, where no path was to be,
There, where thoughts were dead,
Calm was the face, though the days be hard,
Yet there were smiles as the days were black,
As far as man may see
O'er which a palm was wove.

But flurr'd, as if in furious play
He grappled with some huge plant, that thro'
The medium of ev'ry part
Of man, earth, and sea, and wold,
Sweeps down, and quiv'ring with wild sound
Resounds the wilder vast.
Thus play'd he, and as he streamed, behold
A dame in blessed peace of God, whose breast
With lawless virtue had no shamed-oak
With which might best the Sire of rivers,
Which now beheld such foul divide,
Purse and pearles, from his course to stream
And valley, folarch, or seat of crow,
Whom when he reach'd, he drunken rage
Distraught stopt, and coldly ask'd
"Why so magnanimous, why did you
Allow that sinful baneful bark,
Which right joy should lend this wretch to go
Adventure in, between the heav'ns, and live,
Surfeiting enjoy in pain?" Thus said,
He grasp'd his goblet, and candidly asked
Of God that question; which answer gave return
"Thou art mine; if what I ask be true,
The world hath no thing henceforth in me a touch
But what I am; of thine origin
The whole I am, from the first product
I mature, and all the potential bodies
Thy thoughts expressly senses. In possess'd
True benign origin, not bad it is
That thou shouldst need, which purpose holds the sands
Once drop-like in the genuine cheek, to wave
A kindred wand, or man to awe thy power
With temper'd motion. 'This artery alone
That I shall give thou shalt not lose, nor ever
Bombard of wills. My prongs are three, and these
Thou must undergo; and last,
My gratulated advice give in all the forms
Three phases own. Supream is life; but woe!
I fright thee, mute and entire, with how desolate
Is every life that slumbers in mortal Bay!
Millions of beings slumber: we can trace
No obscure of this interminable well:
Not single spirits, but the kinds, we know
From those we've loved, nor yet can wonder leaves
If immortal; and our veracious dreams
Then see, though sad, with how many huges
Shiver'd at ev'n bed of death, the cries
Of various corpses keep count; but th' extent
Is all dark. And if the branches tell the rest,
Methinks Still the departed life, the unpan'd
Body, and the mangled spirit cavort
As if they knew something. Ye angel wings,
Wherefore weep we, when a sullen darkness falls
On this accursed world? weep we, when
The branches sweep, and from the vast angle
Swells hail-clouds swell the huge malignity
Of disease, that scours all life, and in a man
Convey disease; when the Dawn pours new-shine, and all
The landscape redows, and all Nature lies
Love-bedeseed'd? which Jove? when thick night leaves tumults,
And rav'ning wraiths assault me, and all bewail
The dead young, in bachelor-maturity?
Then weep we dews, so many kids
Ope fresh; tears, so watery, when they swim
And cling in hemispheres, and diffident hand
The valves of human lamp reliev'd?
Wine, so black, when it makes young men sick, delites
Me yet more, and in some smother'd plants lie lull'd;
Mine own friends hand more nobly, when the sense I shudder.
O'er stragglers dimness onward rush'd perplex'd,
Whose steps in some dark maze of audio-clings?
Thro' luxuriant first-robin birth in bloom
Graw huge infinities backward? and o'er twinges
The grim where-arises o'er the creepers paws
And in warm-picked midge-coloured streams?
The baby's smile? the mother's voice with fresh
Lien Ontcker Voice? who haply wont to tell
Me from upon my one fair God, on high,
Down-pait down the wave; on-topmost palm; and held
At evening birth, and morning utterance?
So may I face the past yet still be one,
An arm for Lucretius; still admire
Him and confess; and with a man's devotion
Forget not that prevent'd with so much ease
I hindered him; and yet knowing still

 poor light before me that ill might be
Which no kind looks would sweeten, as 'twere,
Were it a shadow from my mother's tomb,
That, turning in its momentary flight,
Touched not my face with pure, prelusive breath.

I do not know if I should call you mine,
Nor do I know if I should not claim you mine;
But this I know--your promise, if you will,
To truth will bind, your faith will hold more sure:
Be still my own, and be the first--my queen.

I have laid waste the loveliest flower that grew
In this haloed, enchanted month of June;
When moonbeams linger in the dewy blue
That lifts your face of peach to create
A monster in me, too perfect for my eyes.
I have tempered hope with hopeful paranoia--
Now, now I've found the pitch of ideal boy--
I've lost him, I'll say with quiet eloquence.

I will keep you, my own heart, from decay
If I have kept my eternal soul in you,
The same to lean on, the same to call me home
When I go forth into the civic light of day
Where beauty stays that fate has left me--
If I have a home, I name you the wall between!

Oh, excuse me, Heaven, grave and vast and wide,
If I have claimed your existence without a claim;
But I have given you back again to nought
That claimed you, and all that lies between
A death and a lifetime, pray, Heaven, more quiet,
Or lie close, hide your head under it with me.

Toil, my own city, we have been true
And true alone through yourself could find
Work that was work, a home that was home;
All that was mine, all for me--did it make
Essence of my being to say "Mine"?--
Were it not better to be anything
Rather than "He works in hope of it"?

Work is a glory unto itself,
A little glory unto itself;
For the soul that hath been happy and strong
Out of the heart that turns from faulty tiles
To riper ground, unto old and young
Work shall be memory, and hope the rose;
And toil--the long, longing toil--the trust
That gives full existence to the soul,
And that is joy, and that our instant pleasure,
That is...

And the good is greater than the good,
The glorious than the precious,
And there is light in hell, if you can see it;
For the work--no matter how it is made,
Is always its reward and nothing else;
And it is glad in its little day,
For what is happy and quiet is still night.

And the world--it suits God perfectly--
Is the mouth of this same world that hangs
Outside the lips that were too deep
To understand a human soul, no, not one.
The lusts, the crowds, the mission, the scourge
Are the body temp'r and the sword,
And, in this flesh, the soul may come or may leave,
But--which is first--the broken hymns or the flying feet?

We had been friends, foratial, erbenfut, atavistic makers,
Of castles full of life-immediate lusts and tales;
But now we stand upon the last, real threshold of life,
And all that I have made, or else accused of making,
Is yours and mine, and you may choose to go with me.
We had been pals, a element ineradicate,
By taking up with too many irredeemable, monstrous wives;
For now I turn to the definite thing that was a friend,
And if I sigh or if I smile it shall not be for writing.

Our line may be Spezzian, but your Whistria, I transfer
Not the least power to thy supernal muse,
O dust I have been, thou air that I did ingest,
O gaunt molars, clavicle, neck and Wicked's abuse;
And if the old blood of Europe earth to pool with peace,
Whate'er it is, this coal-black flesh, this barb'rous plant
Othman threw in his toothache day, or what's his birth,
O 'twas but venial, so 'twas the life that be confined.

Then we swung on our arcades and balustrades,
But the air was dry as a biscard in the desert;

And from the grove where the kine drink,
The green dews may a throat take,
And no nectar be,
If she be slack with the young
In the far bower where the tamer
Knees them.

And let no man mock thy fair,
Though the sea lie heavy on thy brow,
And storms may play with thy dew
To thy fair limbs and the wool
Of thy hair;
Nor let thine heart be sad
For a little space
When the soul's full heart and the voice
Of great pain
From the sea comes seaward.

Though land and sea bring gifts to thee,
The glory and the pain,
Still let the sea take pain,
And all the heavings in it;
And, being thus filled, weep
As men weep,
Only mutely;

For the storm is not this night,
And the night is not tonight;
And this kept tongue, and this dark world of ours,
And all these leaves apace,
Still shall be here years after;
And man must tell his sorrow there;
But other tongues may live still
To make new tongues father,

And other days may be
Here in the grave or in life;
But only this night there is
One night to this man, and one to him,
One sleeping-place in the land.

The highest thing alive
Was that which slept in his dream
The stars and the wine in the sky
Of God's garden, and the fire of the sun;
And the deepest thing alive
Was that which slept in his sleep.

"O God," he began to pray,
"O God all things that are!
The world take with equity,
This dark world give way to
From night's own heart depart!
I pray one thing, and one alone:
Give me to drink, and I shall cease to pray."

He ceased, and slept not, but all three
Of that terrible trio,
In splendid form from court
Came down to cellar, and there in poverty
Potted.
Their bottles were other things.

Of sun, of rain, and of wind
The things on earthenware,
Shining the gleam of the stars,
Shall not bide
Old Revelation where the glittering bowls be
Of rich and old wines, of precious flesh and bones
In the golden ages of God.

Till the still empty house
Gently infused their spirit, and each
In some high place of sanctuary
Poured forth the cup of his prayer,
And from the roof or dusky wall
Of that enchanted garden, or the altar
From the draper's golden roofs of cities,
Where art and nature are harmonized,
And thereunocence may make her choirs
Amid the low world's endless wrangling.
Then the mother of God turned her
Face toward the window, and in a while
Her loveliest with grey hair waved in,
And with her lovely orifice naked,
She cast back the draught, and kissed the men,
And was forgiven.

The wine had set her blood aflame,
And the natural redness in her cheeks
And cheeks which had but inkled been
Had taken fire and freshness, and
From lips where had seraphs been bred
Or passions whiter and whiter.

But in deep rumps and secret places
Her breasts were litten, and the fire
Had entered, and for months and years
Burnt there, until the sacred site,
And the holy part, and the place,
Or something made of pure endowments,
And the pure sweet body, came to love
As the best singers, who had first sought
In hands and breasts the new Spirit place.

Some hotted way in love; and it befel
They chang'd their place, and to new manhood were sharp,
And swift to fly, and deft in warlick; and they flew,
And rumpled ruin.  There fell sore dust among
Whoso held his armour, and one made of horn
His horse of victory: all were horse and shield,
And close together rode they, and one rode fronting
The other.  Whosoever of them swung the shield
Across his arm, and overbore his shield
At right angles, felt the steel cut through
Within; or heft the sanguine blade across
His shoulder, and so drave it on his foe
Whose limbs below were set the ground in thrust.
Such was the man who with the stroke that wounded first
Transformed, restored that bridge by feat of arms.

And we may be in peace together.

With choral prayer let us be met,
That when the land unrun is,
And mighty Jerusalem
Sinking, her wall with peace shall fight,
Till the world—before ours shall be
In perpetual peace and concord.

Shall my little beacon be
Flashing other than in me?
Shall it be in vain? O, pray!
What shall be from the day to day
And life from life a quiet?
What shall be from this day
And youth's causeless bright delight?
That light, rosy, smiling sign,
O God, shine it yet with peace;
And to leave it unshaken free
Shall be from God sometime great,
As thou, as thou, hast made it good.
What shall from birth or death that code be
Which the new soul from its treasured hell
Have with such peace settled in her heart?
She has, at last, in foreign eyes,
At home, in local hearts, to stay;
And they, who had her and her own,
Or in another way were her own,
In all they had her, knew her not.
Now, she to whom they had no fear
Shall have fear for them, now she is dead,
And in whom is no memory of
She was a light to them, as is
The fruit of Babblingfield once more;
Who, that they did not understand,
Did all things straighten for themselves;
Who called the fittest deed great or small,
And punched mean devils twice, like Liberty;
Who made the weirdest cathedra funny,
And read most collections in order.
O, taken from her, here I divide,
But not into two, nor divided;
Since I know not which should I betray,
With shaking pistol or under-theoret.
Ah me, how sweet the thought was in it,
Division most English, though not famous!
My heart fell, seeing their dark chief,
Mazzini, such as heart to have her;
For reasons manifold. I cannot match
Their wit, nor soften their infuriate soul;
But drawn, I understand them, though blind.
But I, a fool to my own opinion,
Cannot understand these first, and next,
Now cast in a three-faced lot; as well
As taken in a.

I pray you tell me how
You can be sure
And thus at once and so
Sever it more than once and thus.
From our cruel side at once
With greater reason!
Our meaning?
From their own
Comrades?
Or from Death, the cannot live ennobled,
Who thought all other were undone,
Who thought they were cleft up and cut up
And put in soul and body as the corners;
Who thought that this or that was out,
And caught, and thus spake mean worm,
'Life is all cake at top,
Next come a load,
No friend, no nothing.'

You understood? So do I; and see
How we mean, 'business as it goes.'
We mean 'business,' as we can;
And not in time, or price, or age;
But life and life away.
And yet, you and I being young,
It slipped not our mouths that we said it.
No tattling of a secret spilt;
And, little by my faults or crimes,
Believe me, 't is now so bright;
Not so: you and I are white;
Think you the moon is white?
But that we can talk of it:
Do so, my dear, who will not speak;
Though you and I may now think 'Theie;
Not all; but such as hold it up
To sun, and moon, and needle;
You smile, and think 'Tis only jest,
Or a kind of sepulchral line,
Hath fixed her:" and I spake, and cried,
"O Death, O Memory, of tears unbound!"
Which you, by this, Sir, made less lest
I then, without, or difficulty
Might say, though, break those papers; but then,
As I remember well, it rained so
That I, getting out of them by means

He said, you must not let yourself be carried away; You cannot be a poet, he said, if you are not married.
But I am; I want a little fun,
Am mad to be writing little poetry,
Am going to submit it; what should I give him? A ring? He said, if you are married, you may have whatever you choose.
You are going to submit your verses to his ghostly eyes,You want realism, he said, to make your poetry.
But realism is a fool's trick, not real, he said,
You are going to write your history of agony,Your life your masterpiece, and he will tear it up and tear it down,
He will keep your little part of pain alive,
You will work it till it does not matter anymore,
Or you will not. You may be dead in the process, he said, but you will not know it, you will be still,
And he will write you as if you were living,And in writing he will make you see things you cannot understand,
To make your whole life one endless public performance,
He will write you down as his friend, the white and red of his pencil marking your oppression, your victimhood, your martyrdom at the hands of unthinking men.
I say, I submit to him, and am now, he says, and am made,I live in the record of his blotting down to his goals, my history a constant screed,
A fat book, a list of all the sacrifices he says I must make to get back to my pride,
My self-abnegation, my freedom to do my part, my fear of his punishments,
My duty to my brothers who have been tortured or killed,
If I be true to myself, to my fellow men, if I, he said, am not these things still?

"Blackbird", by Nance Jarr [Love, Heartache & Loss, Arts & Sciences, Music]
This night, I was wandering through the dim neighbourhood,
when I heard a blackbird singing close to me.
I lay down on a bench in the hope he would follow.
He settled himself in a blackberry to gaze at the sky.
I lulled him with my noise, his whole body tense

Once a dog barked on a train; once a flimsy wooden chairmend floated past our door; once I started here—but I'll never go back. It was all above my wage: we drifted away together, I by the skin of her toe, he by the virtue of his. I'll never go back, I said once his name; once I'd said it—but how the flesh can ache

It's that time of year when the earth is saying one thing but able to express it in many ways so the message has no power. The liquids are drawn to the three of us — conscience, conscience, and another conscience licking at us from the inside. The animals are counteracting the negations with their own presentations.

I'm here to serve you, Mr. Chairman
said the Alaska Cable Guy
carrying my gift of a protective
climate change
into the majestic mountains
of Washington, D.C. I
am the total change guy, according to
the national leadership. You the
chairman of that elite
I want to follow into the landscape
where those lives are at, to stay, to
further this cause I'm invited,
to help make history. The cause, you
know, of my spread across the fuselage
of a Gulfstream G650 limousine, stuffed and
banked, a pick-up so heavily
full of equipment I have no idea
how far from the kind of truck
to which it should have been
brought. And here I am, back
in my native land, nudged back into
my native soil, back in Washington, D.C.,
back to the Nation's Capital
to write a love poem about
the Air and Space Museum, and then to
maze of bills and deadlines, where I'm already
on two hours of sleep a night, drinking
Dark Star, napping in my super-luxury.
How the Chief, wait in his black Brooks suit,
pleased to be here, might shush
the show in order to hear my September
Sunday ritual of worship, in which I
tell the tale of what I've done
and where I've gone, and how
I've done it all by a mere 40 hours
to September. 40 more to go. I know
the score by now. I've made my pentameter
and where is my ending.
In a couple of days I'll take my new
body out to burn it in the heat.
The Chief, who hunts reindeer in the snowy
winter, will creak out with his pack,
returning only for fire in my home.

." "I am a dreamer, uncle,
Yet in this kitchen you'll see me cook.
Cook's surprise breeds new surprises.
My mother always said, 'Good git away
And take long walks, uncle.'"

The Jack o' Hearts sits down by the water-fill,
The balloons float up to the day,
The Jack o' Hearts eyes the wood-fire brew'd
With which to charm the goodin' lass.
He seizes the time, and as sweet as candy
His guests are besit.
"I ain't no fool," he sez; "and you
Know dat to me, you know dat you?
Git out your jug o' Bovider's Gold!"
And all the blue waves get down in it.

"Down, 'shame!" they cry.
Then up leaps Pepo,
He puts one foot on the boil,
An' flop! the blue water flies.
They scatter, an' I get down on my knees,
An' beg an unchanged pot.
An' to make it 10-1, an' for the joy
I'll gits in my gutter every morn.

My uncle John has built a building
Where folks come to party.
And he has a grand hoop in the sky
Blown by the cloudiest part.
An' it blurs the muss an' the muss,
An' you can't tell friend from cloak,
Unless you see that the clouds
Toss the chickens up in the air,
An' they land like a group of golden ducks.

My uncle John has opened the drawing-room door
When the party's beginin',
An' he drives all his friends who respond
Into the hall so fast
To the sandy sweep of the admit.
An' he heaves a present on a smaller drum
When they peep in an' all are "Yi!"'ed,
An' he laughs 'I feels like a king',
Them mighty lasses o' Oriental race!

In bloomin' costume!
How good he looks in his white shirt an' its weighty glasses!
His chin is so white, it is;
An' his beard is so snowy-white,
Like the clean snow of a clime divine,
But there's not a leaf of his hair
Scarcely enough to be seen
In its heave, as it grows in unclouded white.
But the rest, she knows, we have urged it too far,
It would go nearly purple to keep it,
For the color it enjoys, we must indulge it,
So pink an' so white, it is!

In plum pinks, the sex of love!
When we favor one of them,
Her madder-minded sire
Tests her by a hundred
Silliers of a sweet dish,--
But whether it be so,
There's not the shadow of a test
In its desire to be free.

We lash the kettle till it is
Too thick for us to put up
Ear candy, or jellies, or cake,
Or on to do anything.
But it fain would smoke, it does desire
To go, yet cannot be first
Down, in to our department,
Before the company cup it
In their hands and lift it into the bowl.

There is nothing that the brain makes
Think it cannot copy, or band Maker,
Nor that the touch for the flesh makes,
If it serve, for the moment that it
Is propt by the fire's focus,
Onwards still, with ambition, than go.
This devil, his call has aroused,
In the cream-pot it tells him to be bold
To his side and aid him to the end,
But his brain is wild to seize it, as it gains.

Not in the powder, or crystal,
Or the gems that the gemman weaver you unbeguiles,
Is there such beauty as the skin's cream to that extent
Where the light mind meets the surface, touched thereby.
But lured by the shade's delight,
For it's his hands, that he's at it, his needle sets in motion,
He would weave it for the sake of the mesh,
Nor he lets go, lest the strands should fall.

This gem has been placed on my brow since I was grown
By my mother, who was virtuous, for her mind
Raised the possibility that shame were the consequence
Of my drawing lip from lip, when the speaker
Was silent, by no means disposed to consent
To give me a hint as to how best to set
The bow-thong. No, my girl's inclination was

While I alone have stay'd.

In the song of my voice
So waked in my soul!
What the burden--what the strain!
And was this the meaning
Of the rapture and glory
Which I heard on the air!

In the music of my voice
Such a felicity!
What the pleasure--what the song!
And was that the heart
Which gave unto me
This immortal pleasure?

Thus, unto me
Me hath God planted
The immortal air.
But for this worthier Mnictesson gives
Heonde gratia; give her once,
If you'l give me too,
No tolle to barter.

Love, the great admiring spectator!
Yonder the window and the rafter!
Since the sun to the Shining left his sway,
Methought I did see the sun again:
Through the mist of a shaded sunshine my spirit saw
The glorious city of young May by shade and shade famous made.

The country side lay like an orange blossom
In the light poured from the surrounding wood;
On the sky the metier of a summer's day
Gleamed blue and crimson in the brightness of morn:
And behold, in the tropic shadow's caress,
From afar, O perfect angelic creature,
Behold thy vot'ring father's self.

With the small hands, grand pronounce mien,
And the great mansions recede:
And the fields like dark cataracts deep appear'd to listen
In water'd glooms that love of thee had hidden:
O thou bridge that laugest over
With a joyful hope, and over
Flash the sighest hieroglyph!

And thou bridgest when a God came down,
Standing in power nigh to the heart!
Heard were the sobs in the valley grand,
And the ecstacy in the mountains deep,
Of the King's return, of his childling's kiss;
Vista was opened, awe was daydefugue was gone:
Passangs were on thy skies: they know'st thy magic power
Since thou ere a long time thine own son hast made.

O Parkman! thou that hast the loveliest bow,
Wast the wettest number of eyes to gaze upon,
Most memoriferous have the most wondrous power:
See how the light of the Seven Great Books shines
Thy sidelong regalia surrounding,
As with touch soft as jonbiddooe's mouth-offensive
She rests on thee, and thou regent of all!

Parkman! thou hast had enough of female wiles;
Thy consort is outright rejected:
I in my bosom have strewn the cloth of reason
Choicest of all the cinnamon-flavored snows.
My heart is light, my love is full, seek me not:
'Tis a bad hour for thy traveller to be walking.

Nay, my love is not like dung about to go;
It is not gold which the poor shall have to lose,
For richer the feast of the Lord they will eat:
'Tis not man brought forth by wife's fault, or star enabled
Thus spoken in the spirit; but to maintain
In the written order the life which the heart makes known:
Kindly shift thy mind o'er the charts of sense,
Look by the note, free judgment. Be true! is all we ask.

As a grass-green is smooth, and as the whitebark dry,
So on the mind our thoughts only do they write;
Only the turf is stiff, the clear register dry.
Kindly make advantage man's burdens lay,
On truth and pity take their glance;
Ranged no more here do we behold the griefs of the wise.

Here, man doth forget his own griefs and loss,
Man's own loss make him accustom'd:
He thinks not of all heaven might do,
He knows not how his death shall be stillne:
He looks too much icke-dark for garments to choose,
And too much ill for consort with grace.

Nathless 'tis worth the tending of his spine,
To waken up the knoll and hillocks green
To pave with plovers' cries a pois'ry real.
Yet 'tis not worth while to up and see,
'Tis not in moment or inwrought distress,
That he should seek worldly tows to fit;
The day's peace he wins in due sort,
And heaven its part and motion takes.

Who has power to be revelation's son,
And stand where none but gods have shunn;

"Was he not a man, with a busy life
And affairs of greater weight than our playful glee?

"The Devil and the Deep"
You'll find it, by Camp, in the credit line;
But never a "Good morning" to you;
And the captain's mustache's probably thick.
But never a suggestion of remorse
Or reference to the fact that we can all
Go to Hell--if the Devil from New York can:
We dropped anchor for two days
To the Island of the Fellows, and been there
Several miles only:  then we Pe on
For life on hearty bites the bounteous vegetarian.
My appetite's constantly in tip-top shape
For those great Ifulas of Provence,
But, to-night for something that you love to hear,
In the foot-spreading ashes of the year,
When the forty-five hoist their stripped-larke
On specialist trains, my ears are budged
And tinged:  this rum goes "ba-a" by shrubber here:
I never much cared for Love's revelations;
When people sing their passionate lyrics,
Why more than once did I want to bend
And e'en the rising of the Sun go bracket.
I don't know why, but deeper in my past
Do those sensitive souls who, in fine,
Do less than entirely relate to sheep,
Less than wholly get through with decimate,
Feeling, thought, image, memory
I want to re-visit, nod head local,
"For know, we're both, in easy wording, identical."
But, of course, they're much too male or female,
Grow more Christian, shrink the, go away.
You want to know where their later and sole Purpose lies,
Vote with your head;
Why attend to them? Primly, because I think they have been a
 Curse on the world,
From the time of its beginnings, until they reached their
purpose.
The time of their beginning
They had less than none;
How they stood at a decisive Event
Less than none, present at Births well-bodies;
Till in the Beginning theirs were given over to
Careless-Breathing, Contagion, and Hell's Adversary,
And enthralled by Fancy, Gods with Charms, that do
Ingsociously all that they can to baffle
As much as the hardest gold, and known
By Envy as much, they admire the Infernal Cells,
And the deserving and accreat Conquerors cell.
The little bit that is left over, not needed
To convey an infelicity like a beautiful dress,
To make it gorgeous, and goodly, and fair,
Is by them used ever to distend the I,
And E, oftentimes with mindsom longitudinous,
To treat of E, I, them to record as E alone.
And E alone, I then treat of too, for the sake
Of your experience, and that treats the L as
None else would.  Lying fieldlips, violets,
Flow-fallen tabors, all flowers matured to Perfumes,
And sounds, and ways, are all to her contained;
All, in that, which will sustain her Lute's most plangent strain,
Or pensive Hunter's-song that haunts her slumbers dull.
Pnut then assassinates her strain, infuses
Characcaison in the red-baked wheat,
And branding sings it into musical care,
The soothed Steppe cuts transposed for Europe, and
Among the Scots the domestic mind's beguiled.

Of his own mantle, held in free
Ases, and gentle hands, and girt
With girdles soft, and white arms bare.
So sweet, so sweet they thought him,
What miracle did give him
To soothe them, and make their sad pain seemless?
And went his talk so wise, and sweet, and strong,
And gave such cunning praise, that as they'd been wroth
They didn't seem mad at all, and thought him true.
They said, of course, if such a thing could be
And be seen by common people as we thought,
'Twould be a good deal the best thing now in town.

And people told us, too, that for years he'd been
With another girl--so they said of me:
But this, they said, is what makes him such a hit
At all the matches, for since he was sixteen,
And had been somewhat in the past, people said,
He'd been kissed and fondled by all the barmaids.

'T is strange, too, they never knew what to make of him:
They called him the baby of the barmaids, and went
Packing him away to colleges, and typed
The lad, and shocked his mother, and said there was
A genius in the lad, when he never could speak.
They struck upon this plan to pacify the boy,
To make him sensible that his little guile
Was noticed, and to teach the more
That he was quaking before them, and made pain
Considerate. 'T was said that they had heard some scold
Against the schoolmaster for harboring the boy,
And whispering and smearing themselves against him,
Inform the father, too, that he was a loafer--
And the man would then be less inclined to rehearse
Harsh forms of speech about '\\a quick-silvering' his daughter.

They calved him, they could not look him past,
Nor were too sure of any thing--they'd a plan
With him that had a chance of paying the ransom.
They turned, in short, for collars that they were bound,
And gave him a good shoulder to wear them while he completed
A task,--for some fools took his girl's favour shibandi.

He went away from home for a few days to learn
What was a impudence to be obtained
At such a time, and he came home the day before
That the hot war should be entered, and come
Home for a final scrawling of the text.
And yet the short time he was away
Omitted no slightest chance of this man's living;
He knew his time, he knew his father-in-law,
And made as if there were to-day some hot relations heats
Amid the Story's compact pages, pages, to names unknown.

The '\\us' and the 'an'--the 'id' and the 'us'-and what not--
Shall look at last for their realise'd advantage,
And find that all things weep, with a cold eye glassed in--
This they see in their embrace of the Bosnian Sea,
Where they have long soothed and smiled into so much truth.
The sea is a-weeping, for Humpyback's people go!
And Humpyback is beaddass, shall we say? of the sea;
And he gies only the 'yle' to the 'usty white hand,
In a-weeping, a-weeping, the sea, and Humpyback no less.
They say that out of the Humpyback's kalabre 'rting
Shall rise a new State of the Same or the Same super-state;
And all the 'us' and the 'us' shall be for a wry-neck
Pan-pen, pan-pontoon, pan-dish, pan-pix, pan-mazik, pan-papik,
Pan-papsis, pan-pap, pan-papill, pan-he, pan-el, pan-er, pan-er-mance.
The sea-seas a-skimming with weeping seamen shall wither,
When such Humpyheads live its mad aftermaths of Woe.

The memoir of the brain that grew from a cloven tampoed stiff
To a sort of noddy nudity, water-lilies sulk in their stalk,
In a twilight of leaves that shall seem as stranger than your own.

And full of clouds the line of England stretches,
Then comes the Frost-Moon, a sad and hammering thing,
With  cloud-pierc'd storms to break on steel and seas."
"What e're it hit the earth it les'd no harm,
And well nigh once off London sent a lesse
Of gasmes and mist, which rendered our land so cold
As soon it seem'd as if none had it to passe."
"And as if it were no health on earth
And as if none was, e're our delicatest things,
The filly, which to tree doth most resemble the hare,
To any buckler buckled, runs and roars!
But though my coat was thisekes, I fear, to a harre
It wan't about, for she was hedgeged and shrill."

"When Autumn with sad ethereal boots
Came blushing in, flashing light and dark,
The Moon did rise above the waves,
While through her watery warp-flaid
There seemed to dance a pretty cock.
The chill months brought the wretchedness
Then in the cloudy darkness gleaming
A girl's bare foot. The thieves were there,
With wolfish face, going who can know its reason.
Then went I to a field and, while I careened,
A cow with swelling udders drove my path.
The farmer sows his grains, thistles what is left his land.
And looking back from the cherry-trees
I saw a man-shape shadow-begotten
On cows' udders loping through the clover.
I thought, let us walk in phantasmal forward.
When at the field-property I reture,
The man-shape lies along the shadows,
And I remember strange birds flying in clouds of night,
Whose rain-trickles on the pleasure-groves and heights
And nightly spray with dull mouth cavity-rinsed,
Now golden-cheek-tipped and glittering after.
My foot with firm insurrection and agony
On the mother-nipple fires,
Till burst the whip-marks in her milk.
I blown of by the reaping blow of thunder
Must blow. I clouded with despairing wishes
Must wind my wishful wishes
On wishful wind of wishful winds.

And all my flagging hues are all seniors,

From some strange trap-trapped grass
Flings all its quilt coordinates

Winter is done and gone

Are nailed to search by look
Of some quilled patch-

And those faint quivering sparks
Of striate or 5-spotted

That get 5-times more light
In by-whitewood
Mocking the lights

And lanes of the dark
In which a toe-rumby child sees

Whose vigilant filter makes his workspace

Or why that either must be lost, and so
If thou then meet me, not despis'd, unmov'd

For all th' additional love that I can buy.

For, when I wish to speak with flowery zeal,
And, speaking, stammer, hesitate, or lie

There shall my words be choir'd with angel tunes,

Thou know'st me, and doth thy best to teach
Me how it well is, that we should be
Far better friends then thus to stand unknown,

Where he himself is both the measure and length,
For length and measure in this universe
Are meant for kind. The narrows room to man,
But gives little channel.

Is none, nor is there reason, this corporeal
World, until thou seal'd it with thy golden seal,
Which kindness, when it sees, finds everywhere.
Since, to thy God knowledge of this sinner
Second in nature, though to man only mortal,
Was lordly courtesy, and in it full joy'd,
So that the like thanks he paid, although free;
That joy now opposite, hateful he
From thy pure life severs; and thy friendship
Now mourns wit' harms, whether natural grief
Some particular deed or sufferance
On earth, which pleases thee, expands, adds joy;
If blood to blood replacements be considered.
How does his cruelty the scale so firmly
That he makes one of two unlike whom direr
He cuts off? Did e'en unnatural rage, wild blaze
Of soul-s judge this stillness, or his intent
(And if 't the former, which he covets most
In heaven and earth) unto this intent,
That men might grief-bestreen him with conciliatory
Press, and often pay the bitter price alone
Quirementi sperm's decline, and semen go raw?
And consider, that, save the suitor's pride,
Extreme displeasure is vice perfect.

But, if we stretch our threads too narrowly, yet
These broad to weigh, those careful few the straps
Univocal block, to twist by opposite
Flies the statecraft of the state, and keeps
His flame-torn mind, though dark wills impel;
Who, if his purpose delay'd, or failed to please,
Thought to appease would seek to dictate;
Or from his roving eyes the welter soft
To squeeze aught bright perchance into road-safe;
And from the heart, which rolls them o'er the rubber,
Would try to mold or mould himself.

Thou parter, in every thing that's meet
For thee, the perfecting of the year,
The consummation of the feast,
The man to look and from whose mouth stream,
As the fountain of the thousand years,
The future flood, whereby the quivering
Of all hearts is made two ways to show
For nomadic souls.

And many a spirit crosseth now
In the earthen soil, nor place nor wage
Nor steed, nor beast of burden can adorn,
Nor e'er was statute nor is rule
That holds good in the past.

Thou art those chaste limbs to pair
With worldly flesh, or touch nor drink may spare,
In torrent-cold, in hail, or revelry,
With matin, insensate scarlet rain,
Or e'er the astounded world was brought
To acts of infamy, as now the revels
Engage the waking controllers, whoike swine
Foulemar prevented by law, which bans
In Florida, Aladdin forbade
The swindlem bands and forms of their pest
In Florida, Aladdin forbad
The swindlem bands and bands of their puppets
In Florida, Aladdin forbad
The touching of theater lights
In Florida, Aladdin forbad
The eating of fruit juice by the white
In Florida, Aladdin prohibited
The drinking of wine by the white,
And Lampetie by law forbid
The eating of fruit juice by the red;
And from the numberless other acts,

Wah, mother. Not an hour too soon
to get lost in the world.
And who can have thought the anguished face
and the shuffling body, so still in its pose,
and the weary eyes,
mist-framed like a bottle
where the screw-ineiess might be,
would be there so soon.

He has been dead so long.
I am so sorry for his poetry.
His loveliness was a part of what
the white bottle must have meant.
His broken body was another thing
the screw-in, the body that could not hold,
was the end of.

Aye, he was my brother.
In the bottle's absence
the face, the frame
remained, fixt upon the water
until the screw-in came to be.
But whom would gather the glasses, you
ask?
The mother?

Nay. Her voice is water, as blood-red as the blood
that makes the wine.
Who would kiss this woman?
The water of her face?

The mother is too full of tears
to weep.
And who would gather this body?
Glass after glass?
If I could I would fill it.

What of the moon?
When the sad wine-red body
sprouts wings, the moon- clear ring
that around her drove, that drove,
that drove the mist-dripping heavens,
that drove the mist-dripping heavens,
that drove the mist, that was her tending,
rose unfading between the winged trees
that were her tending, drove her to the Father's thigh,
between the Father's thigh and bone,
there beyond the falling body
the mist of falling body,
there beyond the sacrifice
that was her tending.

Who would gather the glass?
The glass is golden-yellow, rippled by the sun,
the sun-drive drives drove the glass's mother
from the nest.
Who would kiss her?
kissed by the dropping body
that was her mother's body.

Go to the garden.
Go to the garden where the kneeling lilies grow.
Near by the cross where souls are sweetly sleeping.
Go to the garden where waterkisses smilid lips.
The body is dumb, blind with its lily-self dazed,
the body kisses the lips and calls: O body divinely dazed!
O sinful lips!

Not the body's dazing gaze.
Not the body's blind lust,
not the body's leprosy when lily-blending:
A girlish throat, a girlish neck kissed by lily-breathing mouth,
when lily-breathing mouth and lily-kissed neck are breath-cleaving neck,
when neck and jaw are breath-cleaving mouth.
The body calls to the mouth that the body and the throat tremble
like a faun upon a ladder o'er wild garnet ore,
like a faun upon a chest-face split and fathomless.
The body called down by the lips thrills faint call
of a lily kiss: O sinful lips, O mad with lust,
with lust and grief that call,
the shriek from the siphon bloom: O body divine
of the body and scion of the soul sweet
that laugh with the breath of the sun to the body and scion,
the shriek, O body and scion of the throat laughing, O thirst-flavored laughter
of the belly exhaled to the leaves:
to the leaves called by the lips of the lips that the leaves answer:Arise to the light and arise
to the light, the light infinite and the light infinite,
the light infinite that calls: O body, O body, O body, arise.

. . . so the sailor wisteth of the missing sail,
so of the missing sails he wisteth
of the find: of the oak-ley casts
of the finds: of the vast finds of the finds:
Of the endless finds: of the ups and downs: so wisteth
the wight that knew not the whither he was voyaging:
so the wight dwelt in the dim air;
welteth in the breath of the wind that set
above the sails in set order;
the cloud of the winds: of the sails he knew
in order firm and steadfast;
but of the winds he knew not the wave-setting planet-set
when smite was of the breath:
of the wights the elder the stranger:
to the wind he voyaged;
the gale of the gales: the tempestuous air;
tended to it.

On the thorns he plunged,
Drew the green tassels, and stuck fast;
The whole day long they glittered there,
And there was only rue and so
A night, as if he had dreamt of sin;
Yet not so starkly the sense froze
Beyond the forked light of rage's change;
A pink rose of hell
On his lips did wander bold,

Through a cloud of it did run
A bird like broken wing
Upward like a swallow's trek.
And at such a pitch of it,
Such a throe of it, that, had one
Wished answered like it,
The world had been a very dream,
The speech a strange grope in Pleasure's way;
A cloudy song that could but call
For the sake of going from us
Upwards, upwards through the Cross;
And of this the sickle twine,
In the harvest's sombre field,

Yet on this night of woe
No corpse may have gone to its good,
But that of all the earth,
Which now the son did fill
The silent with some wry jest
Against his real and such doom.

Before the moon, like a dart,
Had gone its eager way
From the land of shadows down,
The thought of Dylan came,
A strimmer, of that hidden thing
Upon which rests the dead:
"He was our hope, and he goes down
To our uncertainty; for a song
Did creep in his heart and stick,
Until its ghost, Dylan, seemed to stick,
Until it seemed to sink, down, down,
All of his life, all the time."

The other one was blithe
To find a treasure, but empty,
And a little dragon's treasure
Eager drew after; he had learned
The art of getting it;
And he sent a man just his age
Along to find the slipper;
But, as he led him slowly on,
He, for one little moment,
As he turned southern,
Laughed at his own fear.

There were no roots to bury,
No snag to nail, no hostler to despise,
No fountain to slake,
No tree that was boughs to be;
His head was high, his head was low;
No pass-time was his, no night of bestial bliss,
No well of water to drink;
But seventy more years must have been

If Dylan wanted more,
He could have asked for it; but he didn't.
His was no hope of success,
His was no hope of show business,
And this is why
He never clove the job;
And one has to suppose
That he felt, in words
And gestures, things of desult,
Those num- ber thirteen
Was a little rough

Here's the life of a dead neck,
There is the life of a dead wa;
There is the life of a druggah,
And there is the life of a hammock.
And he hasn't found it yet, if he
Has to go to thirteen minds;
And, somehow, by heart, he has it on the list
With all its weights,
135; and words bring it more near
When he spends thirteen lines
Than they do to another's.

Somebody thinks that he has it,
Somebody thinks that he wants it,
For reasons both and only;
And there was nothing about the matter
That was to do or say.

My dear, he has the aminal road
That will eventually lead him home;
There is no further search for him to do,
Nor thirteen more stagnant.
There is one instruction
That will surely make it end:
Keep away from Dylan! for your life!

I have got the right eye covered
That you think is your good eye;
I have told you that it will shrink
And wilt immediately from your face
Were it even your normal eye.
So keep from touching it, keep it that way!

There is nothing to be gained for me
In hard-booted related bough
Nowon, a changed world out-boarded,
A world whose dream we have all disobeyed,
Where a different woman is about to take
Her place, from which there can't be too much back'-mail.

And when I said I would not love them,
And, swinking and boggy, their clots ran,
I was not thinking about my eyes
Nor Dylan's not too close-held clan;
But I see that my words are on the floor
And they are the limits of my pain.

There has been much talk of new love,

But I must quit the room;
Leave you all your burdens
The room to deal with;
So good-bye, for now:
No more I roam
As wanderer, looker, grand;
But all my parts behold,
All I touch when homeward lift:
Leave all alone, dear friend,
For once alone, and twain:
Come, come, sit with me:
And we will rest a while,
Rest as we will in the shed,
The old shed, old and riven;
And I'll be gone:
Enter and spread your wing,
My little love, my little warriour:
That is he.

"I came from counties' hills and ledts,
Where the dew looks chocolate brown,
And the dragon-lapropine thick,
Like vinegar or rotten nuts,
Looks out from yon country's towers;
In a cottage small I said see,
Where another Proteus crept
To a tub in the kitchen-shower,
Where a boy lay lame--or a little one
That stopped and stared, while a moving smile
Of the deceptous thing inspired him
To unbiddle yet another spindlle,
And promise more with his cunning."

The youth with gen'rous force receiv'd
The pris'nant enemy, with whom
Respect and Justice neither slept.
Nor slept they,--but breath'd a streit'ring fire
Far hilting, and in sunder hewn
Their chrystal vertabae.  Then to cut
Their ties with Sword and Shaft at once,
Forth sprang the youth, and one on either hand
Slay; the other, when his upward course
Belay'd the first, drop'd.  O what a limb!

How trite grows old, conceding juster claim
To those who must remain unseen, or stir
Only by the strokes of Fate!  This cramp
Of strength, this waste of strength, this indigence
Of power, came surely at that time, in fact,
From despair and loss of all-conqu'ring Israel.
The Tribulation came on, but stirred
Not by things that did appear, but words
Concerning Him that knew not and all-seeing Heaven.

Sompn't of Power, of sober musty feet,
Touching our bones rattling down in dust below.

Saw thee, Oh King, from His path aspir'd at death
Lean on this hill, the hedges bow'd with awe,
With wary steps the sable thine:
Shook fiercely the steel-grey arrows hurled,
Bears, wolves, lions, seizing in all places drew,
And Hell in anger rocked, as it were a bier,
With loudest shriek; nor did these fall kindling,
Just on call of duty;--rather curse they are
To weight too heavy for earth, and will not hear us preach.

--A nameless Life, adorning the lowest ranks
With reminders nice of riches more and worship;
How much more to your praise you should have been elevating
By domains renounced and majesty withdrawn;
Vast Time was given you for development, development,
When one thought allowed all else to die in You.

--Your sojourning in the foul mouth of a harp-shaped net,
Which shit and strutted at each buffeting of your tread;
Forbidding joy unless th' enslaved fervor was splash'd out there!
Your monstrous gluttonies as things which must be annihilate;
And then, how far less for you, O how far less, all
Wretched, not even worth of you utterablis!

--I swear by the dignity of shoes in your lightest hair,
By your vision of smiles, your sweet delicate love,
Your sense of style in all things which spoils the best;
By your scanty robe, by your pride in not wearing one,
By not owning that, which if worn by a man
Which slave as desperate as this must prove;
By all that courtesies man-fact Should worship or care to gain,
I bring this evening from your favor to a close,
Not, as of old, shewing of fierce and knowen sight,
But one whose light, which if it be said begrinds the blackest sky
As do the Sun-deformed shooting stars, at least may be
More pitiful to see.

And this is Love, I stand firmly resolved to catch the worm.
Now if you wish I could roll the stones for grinding,
And give you timely answers for the wheat we need.
I could clear the dernary swamp, and put in heaphats,
And well-turn'd spades, and well-turned mowing-pieces,
And take and keep the meathooks for dooming
The fall, which you are sorely affrighted withal.
The thought of coming -age comes on me nigh,

They held under law their proprietary,
And owned a right in water and in wood;

If there had been two people in a household, in all
The history of the world, I'd get damnable toll
For letting their swimming-parties have the whogging;
And yet I wish them no more still, if they were men.
I wish them, I think, much good will in a dance,
And they'd take me down for a dancing well,
With my old scores of mind, and a better spotting.

ft from whence he sprung, nor any lingering traces left of him on earth. And as to women as well ye know,
besides our ancient experienced lore, not perforce do we declare,
that on the subtle sense of sense is also subjoined
(as it is with women also) both to the good and to the
evil, and likewise the contraries of them;
and be not surprise, for so your wisdom will not derange
your thoughts in any harsh or olden shape, and ye will not
deceive yourselves in any strange scene. For this ye are
(which maketh us to excel all other beasts, as thou wilt
and to please you, with all thy aptness of eyes and fingers short
to ease your minds) this will we tell you now, and I will
leave you to it, if unto your satisfying this ye shall
have need. We believe, and utter, with apparent truth, that
Lucifer, who is high in the scale of being, as thou
standest also, is a servant of good, who for his benefit
mixt with the spoils of ill Adam (who from affection
nothingness desires not, but only works for self, doing
hate on good, and praise on evil) wholly and along the
ogone line, with subversion against liberty; thus
it is rightly said of thee, that, though clad in straight gold
cloti-wise, he girdar makes of outlandishly curved
sail-puns. Of this none can thinkitcher bethlight
in his halls, whate'er his name or office. In the under-
bann of an omen it is said, " He will possess
raziriy of Adam's son, in which a foul hygromite
it will be found that e'er he takes his out-of-doors." And
we know well that the very heart of an impiety is of
malt, and its wafer is loathsome, if once loathed, and absorbed
in its own sores. And this impiety soiled in its own
invalence will suffer no decay, but rather grow stronger
in its old self-exhalation, and more fiercely after
disgobble the baneful and the polluting sights and
thoughts which burn below the mind in such a maelstrom; and
and that not only in this age but in the olden
first, Whence even the kindred of this Adam dwelt,
and, by outlv quaternions intermixed, the
common Mother was with her own begi-er, there were
long time out-stretched in very unwomanly torture
of the God-heads, screaming of many stripes; whence full
foorth of his own Seat now He makes His Maurits
of elbows and of stems, that behold they and know
no difference,--as touching the beams of glory, the
spread of all unmeasurables.

And every day more and more for Man by experience
gives he new cause for wonder and for tremble;
as when the swimmer, through the watery way
which I have directed him oft, very often does feel
his self raised so high in the sight of God, that he
fearful rise not further in the waters, lest he fall
into the wrong. For every object, then, perceives
the influence of the exhalations which hem it around,
as described above, on the harmandae and mobile

districts of wandering starbeams, whence also certain
aurants are wont to rise, both in heaven and earth. The
soul, too, of each day's dead, however cruel, goes forth
from its body to the judgement-seat of the Most
High Judge, rejoicing; and it comes back again of
each thing that dies there to an inheritance, to an
urn, to hold the whether and noling, which it got
not of true or false. Thou mayst think, o'Ferran, that the
liveless bodies in this sphere must renewed movements have
than in the earth; for otherwise would they live forever
when put together without force or wisdom?

Or else, not after trembling and sweet submission in one
state; for then, surely, man should not be free to
each pleasure and laziness; but every pleasure and
glory should alike bind him up hard to his fellow, whether
he be in hell or paradise. What hold we here?
A state of bondage? But O, I forget! O that my pleasure,
sweet or otherwise, be once once brought home to me! I would
so change, and do, that I would change my body even.

And the bird do fly in sleep,

Like a bird upon a channel
In the shape of a wide-hipped T.S.,

They was a mighty flock, the flock of a king--
Of a king who sat in the shade
On the side of a hill a-top,
A-heap to his knees, a-stake to his knees,
While a choir of little calling birds
Chirped in the shade of the trees,
And no other listener there might hear
Save the king and these two alone.

I said, "What music is this you sing?"
But the birds answered not, they themselves
A record perfect did keep
Of their lord's pleasure, the blaze of the day,
The fall of the leaves, the sound of the wind,
While I did rest in the shade of the trees,
Bashful and stark and still.

I said, "What songs are these you sing?"
But the birds answered not, they themselves
A record perfect did keep
Of their lord's pleasure, the fall of the day,
The blaze of the day and the song of the wind,
While I did rest in the chill of the trees,
And heard not the song nor the tune.

And I thought, as I pondered the fact
That the birds sang not, fact with fact
I thought, "What were ye then?" I said,
"Your song or your king's name,
Bashly or named king,"
I said "No, boys,
'Twas a simple tinker moth
That hid in a raisin.

"Learn't or guessed, ye may remember,
A king might be as beggar,
Sorrow-beget, and sting with a sting,
A beggar-peer of the pittance
That the jackals steals with his loot.
Ye have eaten of the apple,
A king may be, a beggar-peer;
But ye and I are friends,
We have drunk up the fruit."

"And ye and I," I said, "the quick
Haste to conquer, the strong
Speed to give and to take,
Crown'd with the crownings of Battle,
Crown'd with the crownings of Death;

"We are sons of the sun! and the moon!
And swift as the wolves or the wrecks of the sea!
And swift as the cats or the cats' furl-leaf!
And swift as the prayers of a man on the eve
To God for protection if he speaks.
And our race has been side-by-side
With the stars from the shore;
And here we are free to go!"

The red-men laughed out aloud
Their mirth was so jocund,
And some blacks are so black
It were a pain to know them.
And some blacks are so huge
That their skin it would tremble
And could foe look like a friend
With a stranger at home.

When the tan is tin- where the crane is lore and toby,
When the tast is talcuzz and talfa's stump,
When the throth is tin- when it is pearm-eat!

"I love you all the more, and hark!
I am told that you have troubbed your master,
I am told his flaws and I see them,
I'm better if thou be kind, or I be not miss'd,
If thou do right what thou wilt allow;
And above, and nothing less than three Hail Marys,
And thy soul is good.

"If thou weep'st, be's not so, dear blist!
And little of yourself,
But like the whiteness of the dew.

======================================== SAMPLE 414 ========================================

Be a wife, I pray; then, from your fickle side,
A heart's mend, so often broken, break:
The troubles of our life out of view,
And quit the follies of our youth.
Then smiling, back to nature take your way;
Reap, and so, at last, die, and let me go.

The Canting-god who cheers the peasant's toil,
And looks by day like an eternal dream
That, lighted by the sun, through earth and sky
Is dragged through the air, and caught up by the moon,
And dropped down near Heav'ns home, is not like him
Who laughs with mankind, and stays one day,
In laughter chasing, in his glozing way,
Through all the sins a man may have fallen short of,
Aways yet never to return.
Oft, if he his sleeves unclasp, at their meal,
And rounds his lips for a moment to have breath,
A man may see what he was like, and know
What he is, too, without resorting
To all his crazy self.
Wherefore, he who with foresight can lay
That he shall live and suffer these things to-day,

The god who ages unaged would evince
For ages dead, is he. And thou, who art
He too, who for his greed professions need,
And in his deeds would prove false or certain,
Yet deservings doubters, here must deny
That which thou art, to me still with reasons true:
And if he must be guilty of frauds,
Thou shalt be foolish; but, for all that, still
Presume him virtuous, and admire the w Win -
th t y r h a ns o r sphered below,
And by that proof alone this praise is mine.
To whom the other, mildly looking on,
May seem exemplary, and may seem
All indication of a noble trait.
Win - t y r h a ns stands, may not be overstated,
In honor's lists a hero; and in it yawn
All vaunts of desert, shame, or distresses,
Which, touching his own affairs, would show here,
Like some ship that lieth waste, be-quipp'd to its port.
But, mighty mother of mankind, who soul
With sun runs like a river, and is truth.
Thou, whose measure all the time is true;
Mother and friend, whose side is ever with the wise,
And whose true religion is the veriest guide
Of all right conduct, on their happiest minds thou fallest;
And if once invited to what thou dost write,
And allowed adequate scope, shall thou perceive
My firm belief, high rationale fulfilling,
Unto man's nature and his powers divine,
Holding that many of our species still
Wage endless warfare still for woman's shrivel'd!
In that thou hast conscribed not the fool,
By whom the writings of such reward are made;
In that thou hast given him force to fire no more
Our at-likely minds with like hallucination,
The travail home of feeling, to the spectacles
Of artifice, that can'st for organ no longer,
But in the light of other-intelligence turn's the one,
Then, being only truth, must the other be.
This unto Fra Pandulum's book might we copy.
But little needs to be here; for nought e'er will quell
The thunder from Jove's tomb, or change the creeds of Greece.
Here, Robert, now ring measure; now, Carter, lend us grace.
Who can value a rogue, must be fool of the year.
Three days previous,
On a calm morning clear and windless,
Had a girt up horse of the newly horsed 5,
Come thro' the fields of Hautdelmonme to show.
The young man wanted nothing. He only spent
A London morning riding from Lincoln change.
When, coming up from Prent-Exze, the horses made
A little show, which went "drawing pretty dark;
But, just compare the pictures, you'll approve,
And see for yourself, if I'm learning to ride;
I'll say all that I think of the novices say;
I think a bit, but then, it's lots of reading."
So balance this companion of his youth,
And think, when you've studied enough, you're wise;
But not so fit that you have choice of discipline,
You still must have chosen the worst of aides.
But now change; the change has made him much to blame,
And made him charge of the every-one here
======================================== SAMPLE 415 ========================================
O father of my children, that old
Kierkegaardian seer, his memory holds
A garland of white roses on the sick
Heart of the poet, his blind fool.

And this, this is he, I hear, is he
Who with the wreath of trees would hedge his
Proud brow, and the wheel of wheels
On the road of time; the majestic
Earths of their leaves, and, in the case
Of the purest, with a thoughtful
Maze in his mind, which to us in our
Great choice of words
Gives rise to an inappropriate
Apprehension of the sinful as the holy,
With a sense informed by the nature
Of a man so high a person's as the godlike,
With a stature as great as that Demopoulos
Who let his children go free, who showed
Such wisdom and such mercy in getting them
Through all but the last opportunity that was.

There, by the road fair of Italia,
Was left the sinister crime, and he
Who in an impious manner hid
And beturned it, as it had been
All of a piece--black shame,
Imperishable infamy,
Festering one's honour, till the
Dust of the damns be effaced
From the world's face, and the man
Of this day shall have been its face,
Though at least for another life,
With all of its finery of guilt
And wrong done by blood unsated,
And evil done as well by air
As by blood, and evil stayed
From the mouths that were itstypetually
Prepared to spout it out, and held
The universe as subject condition
For the sport of a blunt-d Nose and joy
Of seeing a long froth of foam
At the summit of the universe,
Chosen from all other and sole entrance
And refuge of its own misdoings.

The sun upon its face burned dull and blued,
And as a thing affted with porridge and bread
To be swallowed silently
Weified, or drunk by those who waydually drink,
Its radiance, across the whole landscape
Stood out incurious like a snake,
And not one leaf of the wild rose, nor
Sift of the heavy satin of the mist
From its sheer robe's surface, clothed it
In the wanton criminality
Of being naturally curious.

So, standing there, and many days
Having just passed, and many miles raced on
Through the dry grass, star-flicked now and then,
And patches of shade, and where a garden shone,
Or where a orchard and its goods were spread
From one blossom of a star or more
By a shepherd or a shepherd in distress
That has died and gone to ghostly thither,
Where never a sound, just the beating
Of the of hot big dogs in the manor
Or the tame horse by the military men
Training them, or the twittering of birds flying
Was all to the knowledge of what was there
For the knowing, such as had entered
In the nest of darkness for the dead,
Being for the wakened to enter,
Being and yet unsubstantial number,
Being for those who came and were not,
And for all men not born, but once only.
There were no sounds but for the thing and its death,
No shadow but the vital one,
No being but the spectre Entschined,
And for those men who had awakened and known
That their fathers and mothers and brothers
And uncles and men one and all whom they had loved
Entrusted them, and for all women who
Sang them gently with laughter and fire,
Who in whisper of the today
Had sworn by them, who prophesied
That the morning would clear and that the weather
Would lessen and change to grey and amethyst,
And as we went down in the car
That mountain we were headed for Madrid,
Which the Grecian chain was none to command,
So the good Diego set out for Granada,
And I to Rome--schemes credits strikes again!

No shadow upon the living or light!
Oh, the sunlight falling upon the lot!
Bright were the lamps in the ruins; and
White and dead, and for ever absent
The flowery, quaint, trellised thing:
But, alas, as only the night before
It lit the theatre,
Which the dark blooded Vaublent took
At an exclusive hotel,
With a door-piece who'd type on stone
For old imperial guests.

And, as I came, as I came
Around the leaning pillars,
And the little clock ticked past
The thousand times five,

I saw two by two.
I praised their puffs of paint,
And then I saw that two
Had to be three,
Because
I had to write a paper,
And, if this were two,
I had to say, "Two
Were better than one."

We love you here:
You see?

'Twixt your two moists
Of song.
And eke the height'rs
In between
You hear the river, river, river!

The log that's under the root
Is no more a log
Than my warden's (lady's) crook,
Because, when she picks it,
It is her neck
Deep down within its tomb.

My days, when I had strength,
Was broken to waste
In tryin' to do
Much more than man, you know,
You know
What the last show I had
Was, when the lord t'wept to see' -
The sky, and the stage,
And my people!

Good speed to you and may the trip
Be all agleam, Sir,--
And if it 'tis not to be so,
Tho I'd take again
The fling
I had before.

Wy, the family pantry!
Wy, the home circle!
Hats off!
Who'll have, who will have,
The captain-balls!
Ay, the big Captain-balls!
And I didn't!

Ye that are the type
And the type
Def have won the race,
Look there
A little better
At the little flibbert!
And if the little flibbert
Can rise, how about
The little broom-stick!

Went weet till the water swink,
And there she was:
Surely she's an angel, a one
Under the sun,
That's-as-hail-them-again,
And-her-looks-like-her-mystery!

She was a bottle-bearing
Eighties gal
In the bue of a star
That our earth began;
And she sit there, as I sit here,
And I don't see her face,
But I think I hear her breath!

She was the seventh queen, from hir first -
Rose bazar to bazaon -
And the jewel in our tale;
And that's how I have rated
The part she's played in the episode.
Shes a piece of shapewear
To eyeshot, a piece of scrub!
To the heart's left side I think
My countra eye's the place!

Well, now the affair's cold.  And I)
The story's so on the mind
That I can)Treat the matter cold.
Like a certain type-good-brither-writer.
Lord! the fancy's scattered.

I never saw her look so curios;
And I said never, never; and I spied
A reason never to evade.
Her better-half's pore out of her
Een shtreence here; and she mind her convex -
I mean the fancy.

Her boss, your person-iddler, sir,
Did well to have her show
His self-respect! wouldn't have none
Play'd him dissimulate.
Though a massa's among
The men of sensibility
May desire a more
Impractical good,
He's less likely to turn up wale
Than a show rat!

Well, the thing's taken a pice,
'Tis dark at the mush, I weet,
And it's clear the book
Has sloshed around all wrong.
No grey day e're was so fleshly as this,
Never was the kind of book
That made a man glute, or brain
More squirmy.

I say, what would she make, I say, watter, tailchatter,
Or what? - a patter, patter, patter,
Would she e'er so grimey?
For she comes a grub or two - she comes
To the same thing:
For a woman and a book,
What's the advantage?

Well, as the book came slinging,
A fellow mouf did meet it grum,
And he shook it off his nose,
And he ruffled it up in his beard,
And he blew on it;
But, O why,
They talked on and still could not agree
Like the Puritans did agree
On the holy men.

masted ships in my village,
strolling on the open sea.
Of the vessels from Denmark and from Spain,
four my fathers made, and a fifth was mine.
When I was no more than a boy,
I went with my father on a sailing voyage,
and I sailed as captain and pilot of those ships,
as I have done again to-day.

As I was steering, sometimes we had rough seas,
and strong winds, and the ship was frightened;
as in Denmark I learned their habits, customs,
and days of sailing.

But the climate was different there,
and the light was better, and the sunshine clearer,
and the distance was less;
and the moon was never full!
I have sailed many times on my life, but this
is the last voyage that I will ever
make.

The light brown eye of the little fragrant red-clay
that peeps into the valley every morning through,
the backs of the young and agen-syllable trees,
the way of floating along in a flowing line,
and the child who has learned to ramble in the tight
and crowded docking-place of his forest-family
--
--all these things I come back to thee,
and thy sea, thy course, thy forest-world,
and thy will supreme,

and my course must keep true!
Thy hand is there, and lo, it is clear
as air above, ether-light, and wave and ground,
and the silence that is only matter
from whence to shake away!
Till then, I keep clung to thy rear-edge,
for, swift as bounding moth,
I go and come, I go and come,
myself, thy child,
my own child.

I caught an eagle this morning,
I caught him low down among the reeds
that grow by the river--on either hand,
by the pond, and I thought 'captious nix-nix,
'How daur thou sneak o'er the boundary stoure,'
but, edifying anecdote, he said 'Hi!
Let's play a game of tricks, Jamie,'
and, like a fool, I went uptopp
Like a fool on leveret poker,
and he wanted a shoulder-blade
Like my hand, to hit on the ewe-bone castle,
so he pushed back his paunch,
and hit quite heavily,
and so made the least interval of
jaw-down-the-snout gaps
between his blows.
So that when I had got the trick
and had my killer elbent,
he missed his chance for a slice
of meat,
and I caught him clean on the end
of my finger, so none of his
splinters hit him,
and I tied him free,
and his eye flashed witrazily,
and he made to swear
before he went bawling
'Faster than wind,
but I crumpled up his cards
of jacks-and-losers,
and threw them in the water,
and rolled it off a diethle thave
he swanned gleefully from,
'And now I'm the only man in town
that plays a thief,
And I've the Burr of Inconvenience,
with its high reliefs of mischief
and punishment,
and washerwoman, and its nameless danger,
and the in-batches of despair
and mob-cries of the trickster feller
that steals the butter from the kitchen
and runss wild through town,
And the suspected felon hangs himself
and the grandam is shot with an air gun,
and the little girl drives the nails in a X,
And the puncheon from Black Smith hangs
on the byre, and hard by, a pig is being butchered,
And the grand valet at some lawyer's advertised,
and lopped-off finger raised on tiptoe,
and the poor grandchild in books and grades,
and the grandchild running about from a pup,
and the hyperall youngster riding home-country side-stopped
by a woman-servant and the wife's cheek rubbed with paint,
and the sleek roan that jawed and nawed and slept in the night,
and the brood of White Horse under the four-year-tolds,
and the butterfly-topped adolescent blood-thirsty
mouthing a stud, and the horse-mouthing a mare,
and the brood of White Horse over many a mile,
over many a mile of bog and bog-gy desolation,
with their gouged mouth flaking the hardwood forest-tangle,

Pure as a saint, who holy rites
Both masses and sacraments devout,
Whose face is fixt upon the blazing altar,
For Heaven or for Earth veneration,
And is worship, all things fair;
O blessed Virgin!  O great World,
We bless thee! and wish all things thine
As thou art!  We breathe to thee
Hail and praise! and no forbidden thing.
But most we thank thee for thy sinless child.
For all are steeped in Sin's sad shade,
Our souls fold up within their wombs;
We thank thee that thy child may be
Lost not in the bright blaze above,
But made an angel above,
Thy witness, and thy partner in this rite.

The day is set, and the ceremony accomplished,
The sprinklings, are done, the rainbow issued,
The chorals and high Mass parting, when
All with sweet patience bore a touch of mine,
And I bid adore the Infinite.
The curtain goes down upon the play,
And curtain effects in the air prevail,
And more than eye can believe, we see
A figure moving up in the night,
With a lantern in his right hand, that shone
So brightly, it was like no spark it knew.
Ten thousand leaves of laurel behind him grew,
And far across the mooned theatre;
Ten thousand shining stars, for him were cast,
And for him more stars than there are earth own,
Wherever he might lay his foot.
To where?  I know not where; to where all eyes
Are dazzled by the fountain's light, many agree
He did but go--that is, they went with him,
As if so minded; we, some way warped, were down
Where few would go and many would stay.
I was just finishing my commands,
When other troops were going to the West,
And I was placed, all contingencies confronted,
Between a French Field Corps and a Tamer Country.

Somehow I ended up in head-quarter, though my posts assign'd,
While everybody else went to the East in search of glory.
And how things panned out, believe me, unless a day
Look'd on, and show'd with a happy day's face, instead of run-back.
For then one saw that even the stars are pale at morn,
And the sea is still, though full of ships to be swimmin',
While with a cry steps inward little Leila moved,
Small-Time Lathia with a heart of fire,
And little Faun full of sweet sincerity.
That night I saw the slender lad draw near,
Tint of virtue I but barely saw,
Le Minister-like grow loudly manly-like:
And the eyes of it were so full of gladness,
And the cheeks of it were so filled with freshness,
One could tell it had been some great hero,
Or some real Baddie since all the land was fill'd,
And a memory no man had to share, but arose
Quite undismiss'd from any human heart,
So great a number of times 't was confirmed;
I think with tears that it was seen,
This thing that honour 've gotten
By being seemly long accursed,
Did to his maintenance do pay.
A little Leger, I must say is not
So much aged like Penny's crane,
(Ah, so many verses have been cut from it,)
Which is, I think, Camilla's duty to declare,
To say so many things that are not,
Insulting lady, with her husband's rest,
At the feet of her Steward self's waste;
Which is, I think, what it did seem
This little affair to be manag'd,
And how like home-spun delight to get,
A boy, that's what it is indeed,
My little darling's guardian, will be,
In home-spun delight, what home is made,
And that's why I like it so much indeed,
If we are boys, and boys will virtue keep;
The beautiful thing is, that we bend
'Twixt home and our worldly toile, to pay
For Sodoma's boys that travel far,
To see moonshine at Phillips's more,
Or bass which nights more favourable are,
And to see banker's trades, drink or no,
And those which have a black more, than they have.

This man Mustumwoo!
He doted on the land
Decoy'd to tobacco,
Which played havoc with his ears,
He thought they meant to win the day.
He ran down to contest.
That man must be a booby to doubt

"Buried Enemy Guns", by SUEva [Living, Disappointment, Social Commentaries, History & Politics, War & Conflict]
Two cities fell in the face of the soldier.
City one: this was his power.
This was his other city: this, was his weakness.
City one: no bullet cut the shadows that tried to stop his game.
No bullet: black, were his shadows.
City one: each woman was a woman. All the guns pointed at us,
but the woman didn't look like a man.
City one: his game was the city one:
the woman was not a man.
City two: his game was the city two: his guns aimed at us,
but the woman didn't look like a man.
City two: his game was the city two: his guns, at us,
but the woman didn't look like a man.
Cocktails, then, then stolen kisses.
Once, his guns.
Then the stolen kisses, then the cocktails, then the intrigue.
City two: the liquor, then the enticement of the liquor, then the nutshell
script of the finale: the woman didn't look like a man.
City three: the finale, then, the woman did look like a man.
The enemy fell.
City three: the game was the game.
City four: the game was a lie.
City four: the man fell.

"Maggie May SEE England", by Lilian Bell [Relationships, Family & Ancestors, Social Commentaries, History & Politics, World View, War & Conflict]
Not by a cover, not hidden down corners,
But by your looks and by the crowd in the street,
By the hushed pace of the hours,
======================================== SAMPLE 420 ========================================
-"For by these signs (said I) thou art known
To me, my guide, my Christopher; but by me
Thy benediction, thy pardon, and love pay.

"For though this should be imputed, yet that I,
To whom thou didst impart this with the heart
Of one not wishing to think of thee again,
Am therefore secure that nothing I know,
"But what to thee is now within the power
Of one, whose thoughts to thee do approach
Just so soon as those of me who know not what
Till thou. Now I have leave to hold my peace.
Go therefore high thithers, and see Lynette,
That Haidee is ready; and besides, perchance
That maid may make thee some knower: night and day
Let ever to thee the best of all those arts
Which heav'n has given me make copy, and on each
Make better than the best that now is made."

He now had turned again unto the place
From whence he came, but that word upon
The mind of Godfrey had eddy'd his foot
To make him turn; so answer'd therefore quick
The running Sue; "Why will you pass in this way
From where the honor, here renown'd,
And where the glory, and where board the god
Of Seres, yourself, may come? yes, the hawk,
The dove, the crane, steadiest of all bird,
The lark, the kite and swallow, wing'd a flight
Beneath your feet, may keep the same course;
The yoke-fellow of the ring-gammon, horse
The same may attempt; this equall arm,
That just can scarcely repress envy, may watch
And temper love severe. If I myself
Were not your senior, the remark title
That hangs on your pledge of helmet'd dame
Should to your honor elevated hear,
And your promise the blessing; but elements
Of lawlessness might still have brought the stain
And still doomed you to gird in easy mood
Some forfeit honour, which once done,--and
The dread danger destroy'd,--forgetting, ev'n for glee,
Should it be sworn you had sworn for what
Should at once your honor and your life ban.
You, if true, are heir to grief; if false,
Of troubles; yet if neither, grief for yourself
And inevitable death.
The damosell on his sacred art may frame
The mystery how the cause a-flow
In both dissimilar streams: but thou,
If answering nothing, know that blameless flesh
Must surely proceed from blood, and that the soul
Unzebbed goes with him, who so late
Completed him a soul pluricent, so bred
By its own barque, at once impulse and act
Fourfold, as in the four-fold countenance
Fourfold, as in foot, face, head, and lip,
For here, though mere furniture and equipment,
The very stamp of body to the body
Seems of its very bosom trac'd, and that here
Complete with subseface quintessence as yet
Quixt quintessence, all according to the quintessence;
Hence springs the various kind, as is that dust
From which the different vegetable bodies are bred:
Nor is there one only one but divers very far
From those that now are freeze to those that now are fire.
This truth I guess, that if the mind be ignorant,
And void of faith that thinks it best to know for what
Aught be knowable, then knowledge will invite
Conditioned by that faith. If assured, that if such thing so fair
Were meet for death, God only, codes nor laws,
Would hardly lie hid: then the will would pledge the arm;
The will alone, as we have suggested, if divine
Therewith participative did not join. But since human nature,
Grac'd with new truth, blames itself for its desire
By what is so unprofitable of mortal strength,
And that which is so ruinous of courage;
That it may know what is unnatural, and what
Innate, we may as well seek to know God's nature
By human thing, as brute. But since the mind,
Pervers in sin, feels will to continue still [in supposition]
Spiritually due victory, that so it remain
Students of nature; that to know it is to hope
Confirmed intellectual, as it accords
With the intellectual best, and is not by it
Taken as a bare intelligence; this, we have said,
From this top pivot, Earthly message as a sun
Goes forth two other celestial messenger.

A white suckled bull, all horns, at me,
I was reaping ox, turning blade,
And his tail, which made soft Bond-water,
Out-breath'd my opposite slumber, white.
The sheep and bull were rounded with amaze,
He was sightless, silver-tasioped.

IV. I turned, I looked, I bore my cat
To her sweet inchards (she should triple crosses bear).
I trotted down to West Wyndham's in a drunken dither,
I drank in France, and England's bore ass,
And Ireland's stoutest pony at home.

V. Then the bull country was all frog's bait,
They swam by leer and pout to gonairies,
Weldlings, and mules, and harems formoruff,
And I was mad for motley that an old woman wanted.
A velvet old woman wanted in my dreams,
And I was nowt to stand an office to hear,
I was glass and stone, unchanging at all.

VI. And what I'm weary of is that no matter how far I go,
No matter how often I pass my eyed eyes,
I, Nigel, will not see the Duchess his legs.
When you had drilled to the river we set down at,
The world was gray for us from Ark test to Ark test.
But now it's blue for you, and red for me,
In the earth where we're wired for better accommodations.

VII. Here's the novel we should both write.
The story of our lives should not be confined
In any book. Let's put our scarlet two before it,
The gold leaves on our two souls, our campaign medals.
O mother, write the story of our lives together
In verses as scarlet as your heart-o boundaries.
And there's the song of the whip and the fox for to turn.

VIII. She was a red and a black bay sand.
(She couldn't the wintry wonder comprehend.)
In her raiment of black and red was arrayed.
(It was the Roses I didn't understand.)
Her hands (where should the wretch?) were adorn'd
(My best wit could ca' thee not with a bye-and.)
A trim-sleeve was smeared with gore.
(My best junk) was given as her dress upon it.
Her sweet face was butter pink glad!
(She didn't I'll tell thee, boy, with a bye-and.)

IX. She struck like a Northern quill.
A dunched sun with a green nose-tip.
(As I was a dunched sun, too, I'm afraid.)
It traced (as I don't know how,) the quote: "I will try
To make the best of it.
(What, nunch! What's flesh?) though I must try
To make the best of things."

X. I gave thee, Mother, a kingly smile
(As fierce I stood, I could have kissed you.)
She struck a flaming look, which flared
The hair on end of her head,
(How, bonny mother, how did she?)
And she looked as if she would explode.
(Sweet mother, my truest friend, I said to her).
XI. The mother, as she should remember
These dainties holy, and decent,
Said, "Oh mother, sweetest, kindest,
You give such grand meals to the King
(As 've made all the money you earn.)
What d'ye think will possibly fall in?
(Oh mother, take some of these loaves
With butter by the sprigs shaken off,
And then my friend, to eat, with you
Sweet-o's yourself from head to toes.)
XII. She looked at her watch with a shifty face,
The watch that the reader of all monologues must know
As the time perforated twice by the penguin's two

Now can I weep, my Son,
As once I wept, ere Love was shamed:
Not the gold of man can pay my store:
I have no land, no house, and no lust to win.

In the green waste land,
With the frost-shift colored skies,
Where the sheep and the shadow-crocidity
Raby me when I am near;
In the shadow-crocidity,
With the black-horn roadside men
Riding over me and scaring the horses
And the neighbors and the vaughan with great peril,
And the righthandmen and eldest of the women
Scolding me and the children and all the brothers,
And the old men and the wives saying,
"What is the matter?
Why are you a whining little prick?
Tell me, what have you been doing?"

With the great big airy men,
With the cruel white women,
I have been killing the little children one by one.
I have been killing them off.
In the fields I have been killing them both
One by one.
From the well-lit fields I have been killing them all.
I have been killing by command.
In the densestwood,
I have been lying in wait
For the white women and the holy men.

Down by the Hazel and the Hodges
Three boys were fighting.
But I did not care:
I would not hear their prayers,
Nor their sweet replies
From the sandy shore of Waitkus,
And at night under the dark owls
I had much more to worry about.

But today, O Day, you turn your back on me,
While they are eating the flesh of our brother,
And drinking our semen-alcoholic tears
To become a little like them.
Take from me, O mother, more and more
With every passing day that passes you away.
O Demon-Moon,
The less I am conscious the more easily I can kill you.

Now I am a God:
My own outmost self I have disdained,
And so I look on others
And all that crucifies us,
And know by body that there is most compassion,
And least doubt that there is no soul.

Red water and scarlet women
Are these,
With bulls to Mays
The things
That come toget her?
O bull-headed,

This day,
With mays
And oxen in the yoke,
She will appear,
And we will see her)
With stern good-byes
And lolling tails--for all her tears.

The next day, with small feet dragging,
The third, with legs all wrong she'll run,
And she will die then--if she can.
And who'll say,
"That was n't love's long finger tipped
For she is truly dead
If she can't drive this bull to the truck?
O bull-headed,
You have done this thing before
When you are under ground
In a secret place,
And she your victim now.

-A Bull--a creature all of red and gold,
Is heading this march
As it has marched before,
But never in its way
Could see what there was of life.
So it did not know

It was only set to die
On a mays on a mornish day
In a place of stars.
But it did not die--
It sees--or only knows,
In that bright, cool place
Of its eyes not seeing white
An avalanche of human dust,
Or the tempest throwing up,
Like a plank gone missing,
Of human bodies.

But only sets its ears
On the fine tops of weeds,
To listen--does it know
What huge death basketies
For it are filled by men
In a day when a sky
With its rain, its mist, its dew,
With all its dead things, and all its dying,
Tells the heart what a wife it has got.

When my last bull expires
I shall want, O darling,
All the lovely things you love;
And you shall sit,
On the shearers' knees,
Slave to the hair
Wound-daubs, and tell
Of the beauty-boxes
Filling the market places.
You shall play,
On the she-goats' feet,

Go, sleep in that other house;
Go, sleep in another bed
With the vows, the amorous lies
Of the water and the lance
Of a last grassy smile.

But, O mine, with the eyes

My troth I'll save it;
But if my fate be to subside

But to save your life, my troth I'll keep,
And kiss your wrist, if I have the power."

"No -- I have no wish,
Save to be home with my father,
And to return to the place

To the swain the deer,
And the wild-boar to the craven hunter,

Let the guardian wind go forth in order azure,
Let three hundred darts fly in the air,
Not single-heartedly, nor with pairings,
But in order and divisions meet;
For the chief's house is never built
By a single alone;
Nor a chief alone, in his own way,
In his own conceit.

Now the western sky is dark with smoke,
And the warder rises with the signal-bell,
For the lord of the whim;
And the sound of the chimes goes up from the hawthorn-tree,
And the signal is answered from the castle-turret.
"To the garage, to the evacuation, my lord,
Wherof an older gentler signal let stand!
That the old folk may not go with pain
O'er the street, as the young ones leap and shout for fun."

A dewy white anhungerant face,
A dreamy glance she bore o'er his,
Who found within her womb a child for man.
Of amygdetness, his mother's changed,
In a great light he shone at her breast.

"Ow, man! keep to th' centre of the sky,
And yon earth, the neighbouring stars of day;
Yield place to ocean, 'warez England,
And bide your peace with you." So he said,
And, in a flash, from the light that broke
He left that, and the heaven that heard,
That scene of awful night.

A hoar-fenced cistern,
In whose oozy gloom
Might sink a star-clasped father.
His toiling son was fain to stop
Nor saw the form as it went and came,
Nor here and there, like stingy caterwaul,
Begun its deadly path.

He passed the castle-gate,
That now is known to every fanes;
The church that bore, and bore to earth
Knew storied Martin's death.
Beyond the church, the vine-grown stone,
Whose alder face, and cracking whip,
Betray'd old England's tally of jailing.

Far up a ramp from truss to roof,
Where deep in the kennel lay,
That night, the citron-snakes' green soft nest,
The puma-mouse took.
That citron-snake to me
Set on my summer full of plumes.
And, oh, its pleached tail it hid,
A neater obelisk than that
That night, all ruddy with the light,
A band of men, a crowd
Of fierce, rough soldiers went,
To quell whom they deemed their foe,
The wild public weper to quell.
They found the snake as on its rack,
The puma-mouse glad on his kennel;
They found him there,
And through a stretch
Of straining communication
They dragged him to their start.

They found him on the western hill,
A large cool spring
As far as eye could limit
Vest aliquest in a story,
That afternoon of fog.
They found him on the emartisan's claim,
They found him on the lime-trees old,
In sogganon, as it seemed to be,
And they could show you he was a Saunt
Who lived on Carrigenzos's Day,
November 8, the Day of Snakes.

For the earth's whole fabric,
And every riveting root,
Is another world that you may dwell,
A limesible kingdom, a realm of snows;
But in this world, no doubt,
The things that you may read in your manual,
Of cities, and of men
Are the steps to Hell, and down the stair.

The neat-orne nation carries you over sea with pride,
And a copper necktie is a lucky heirloom
While a grape-divining life is the nation's boast;
To walk through the world as a mountain, to fall in battle
Were never the purpose of an American;
To wear a cuff where the cardinal
Is the national bird, to wander at large
When the aid of a tyrannous British hand is needed
Were ever the objects of an American.

The hell of rifles and artillery hail.
On ditches, and by streamlets swamped
With human blood that stained the water's course,
They saw the star-shells streaking, rising high,
With barnaclated doom.

The dead were there so heapéd and so black,
That he who passed that morning was weeted
Like manna: and the dying, who were near
The extremest mark of that abode,
Their terrible monument, forthwith accused
Of crimes which, at th' very least, inferred

Had out of Nithè's Court, ev'n & Elizabeth's age
Been hoaxed with crowd to rapine driven.

O friend, who knowed me fickle & fashious,
As dearly priceless as the toys myanders,
Which listening to the mermaid's song
My friend did buy me,--to a fawn the seal
Of Friendship, though 'twas fanged the wolf to jaw--
The boar with fangs that sting a broader one,
Each cheek receiving, being prick'd by all,--
One JOYREFIA claimed I was the soul
Of MOKANNA'S form,--that Beauty thro' whose PANS
The proud look of the world could express,
Nor wholly false & vain--who considered
Man's labour of the mind as a joke

Carrying with him the Hope of all men's days,
Hope being carried past death on Views individual

The airy darts of Fortune, nor look'd for grace
Of Clergy, Members or Manor, where Tribe
So proud hung o'er one Village--nor dar'd the blame
Of women's unblushing speeches, that lied
As much as his own falsified name,
When to his Colony--when to us all allied
In Companion,--in Truth's light he came,--nor fear'd
Cornelius yet a Second Robber take

Of me and of myself, whose fostering Care
Had made him Sufficient for his day and night,
With half a thought and all the renewal
Of's own day and night, his hot soul had snapp'd
The synonymy of some warmer Place,
On which Snoth or Hæda or some Barb whose
Long hour was the right-hand man's prime burden.

And he had seen, and in his turn had blest
By love's instrument, ev'ry unconfined thing,--
The mighty first Father and Prime Mover,

And in a name that is amongst this Grade
The widest renown for greatest Glory hold.

He was the First of Prions, Universal Soul,

A knot of ice
From the chill of the snows
Seized the reins and cast them aside,
Warded with this recall
That all returned to the stem
And sank with a crash
Upon the next slow vale,
Weaving the darkling Rapids
Thicker than ever.
A voice out of the air,
Unspeakable, sang--
"What place is this, then? this
What ice is this?

"This place is a crown
Of ice upon the waters;
Came the rapids, it is said,
From the summit frozen
This minute is taking"
"Man a little leard too soon,"
He spake unto the sea,
"I had thought that he knew
The limits of the earth;
You have no delight
In the earth's crust and mortar
The joy that passes gaining,
The hope of things beyond while
Like the sound of a letter
Like to a shape in math
That composes itself;
You have an ancient fear
Of change, decay, and something
That looks familiar in all
The math of you!"

"The streams of the river
Are a guide for me;
I know that I am near
A shore that no man
Thither can point to"
"Is that the place," said

"A shape at the prow of the ship
That no man has seen,"
And not a man answer'd.
And not a man replied.
And not a boat replied.
And not a man awake in the deep,
The vast smooth white straits,
Saw, or imagined that he saw
When the swimmer passed.

"I know a land that is not a story
That is seen,"
The old man said; "a light at the prow
Of a ship is a guide for me."
The cliffs of marshland were seen
Go past; and now the old man said,
" 'Tis a land nigh the world's end,
Where men are met on the water
With fish from the rivers and the sea."

"On this narrow isle of the sun
There is wine and there is food,"
The old man said. "I saw a dog
That was white, and carried by it
A grey mare." "O I have a dog white too,
That is as long-sighted as the day is long,
That is as fast as the speed of the wind,
And appetit. An Irish haffternipe
I saw in the lane." "Are the mares black?"
"The mare and the sable stallions of God
Were once as white." "Didst ever the double coin,
Red with black, without the numbers a still ring,
Slowly approach?" "The night for all its shadow
From the bottom of my bark learned the hound,
It crawled not through all the cover but one day
Until it stood in the cloak of its brightness
To thunder in the midmost right hand."

"There is a path from the storm to the sea.
A dog can tread it." "I think that the dog
Learnt from the thunderbolt its peace.
I saw a dog. It walked across the rain
Till it touched the dwelling of polished brass
Where they waited for me. Three horses they,
Three masters. Now he approaches the hand,
Now moves the head, now languishes,
Now moves the eyelid to and now the eyelid."
"The storm has effected a march," said he,
"On his right shoulder. He is the only one
So far in armour that we keep together."

The sound was lessened; down it fell fainter, fainter, fainter,
Fainter than dust and smoke where men exhale.
It died, as from a rumour of the force
Sounding of an awful chord, in music sad
As death, or as the music of the grass
Rolling back from the body of the rain,
When silence rushes in utterance at the blast.

The dog was moving. Not senseless, but that
Is the course of all which has not set resolute
Armed and conscious against doubt. The song
Of the active forces in man and in nature,
Throughout the day before the opening act,
Could be heard in motion; and motion it repeated.
And always the resolution, that is,
The choice between sound and silence, was utter.
Each wave of all reality, as in music,
Thru-track, was resounded and in touch with the soul.
No impulse was coincident with this cry
Which was, Now. Now. And not of human sense
Rushing abroad in vain the ear.
Not all unconscious, not under spell,

Thy name, dear Maiden, thou shalt be glad
To know,
So, thus we parted. Thy cordial wishes were
That the two Eternities should henceforth dwell alway
In perfect union, and to answer one another's call.

LUCIFER, your thoughts are very familiar,
And you are a friend of mine.
It is not that I blame you, your being was
Growing up in so strange a household; nor said I
That you were unadornèd, but your eager eye
Showed that you had an intimate friend in me.

If I were living in the rugged Mountains,
And knew that I should be from you parted for aye,
I should cherish the thought, every day, sublime
And affecting, the longest prayer, "O come back."
It would be lost, you with friends and husband gone,
Early or late, and if I were to die tomorrow,
The great event would remember all by myself.

THRICE happy I locked me in the cave,
My lips to stifle the vain delay,
My dearest, first delight, I never graced
Nor broidered a garland for.
What Amma, thy busy, bowering critter brings
In arrayed in distracted care,
I seek, but not one precious gem or stone
Can set, or suit, or wrapper or dish.

The fault is hardly greater than chance,
She might have brought it; was my death the cause?
Could he e'eride feel for mine a moment?
Forgot I this? or all, 'tis true,
That bothers the heart of one who dies.

She pranked me sweet, the Fates must have accorded,
My love could not be held up to reason;
Who gave the ring to dress, I may say,
Shall not be pleased for this, I wis.
I have repeated one half a dozen
Which I really and truly tell.

SHALL I, to whom is all man hath done
 No other word than To and Yea?
Whereat they laughed, a hundred mouths grew loose,
I saith unto them, yea, they are gone;
I did it, to excuse; I was wild,
And ye're the reason.  Where then came liars
From whom, the unriddle'd scroll explaining?

SHALL I wider go, and cover more ground,
Meet all degrees, in wit, in birth,
In all which men importune call To and Nay,
Nothing worth regarding more expensive
Wanting lands very dearly, and crimes
Against the State; which he who doth pass,
One meal at least may be content withal,
And many points of law more quiet thought,
All whereof the family lawyer
Wears out his lengthening day in bidding how
We read the bills through?  Then the rest
Of this, and the rest, he should make clear,
Then the place shall be no more, I say.

The Farmer's all the country like himself,
But he has fall'n strictly work abounding,
And then we do with our dinner run,
Such times befal us as never Janum
Rise by at all, but ascribe them to the air,
From nigntheous molumcent gibbering
Of phenomena that may be acrost.
Nay it shall not matter to a sence
How much befell them, if they do but stay;
We have the better of it already far.

I will mention a newfang example:
From the far provinces we have seen him,
Though in our own back-yards utterly.
What would they?  they have naught to lose.
What would they have?  the land in gulfs,
Or in the lake-waters of a rapid?
But we the profit have, and their damage.
For we be providing to our cost
Of immemorial perfection.

And by his civitas was a town.
He had got into a sumptuous club,
And by his civitas was made cook.
He had no soul remembering what,
For that soul was already three hours.

The club was well invested, for his cubs
Had been at Covent-Gallow's improving
Upon the flavour of their flour-sticks,
And had there gathered the most amazing tale,
In a kind of pices (what can make us all

With his great arm might attack them), and a great many

That, and less, we ought to do for them.

When Icarus, from his moorings free,
In Icarium, no light saw,
Till broken in upon by social bees,
He drew his wings, and was carried thump
By the annoyance of their swarming,
Into that mass of ice and amber,
There he lay and heard them hum their dances,
He saw their little cells of warmth
Through the cold, scrabbed with ice, red and gnarled,
Where the sunlight brought a tingling mix
Of light, and the garden was in heat
Very much like a meadow, high and hot
For the wind was in the sun
Making the trees grow green again,
While the bees sang songs through his heart,
And the ants came from their honey.
And I know that for such a flight
Men are soon bent to wreck.
But ask not what the wind
Did for Icarium.

For as he flew he felt
A little shaken as if so left
He never should have found his way,
And yet not very surely
He knew the pleasure of the air
To go where he would, he felt
How the wind should play with him again
And with his arms.  He saw
Blue mists above him swimming,
Mirage like a giant's height.
In his mind's stroke he saw
Rivers of golden drink
Whose streams the reddened air
Pulsing beneath the tresses
And trunks of trees.  So he drinks,
And this raises a toasty heat
Within his veins, and leads him hither
Toward the hills that lie beneath,
That sank there for a shelter valley,
Where the waves in saltness lay
And the coralcoeds were bent,
Where beneath a shelter valley
Lay a green sea, and through the sea
He saw a city with walls
That a boy might run or a girl could ride.
But as he came nearer
And nearer to the walls he got,
Long he marvelled at the state of things
That a young girl might live in a city
And a boy go where he had ever since
Begin to wend, the golden of the fields.

Now the river that fell before him
Was the worst current he ever saw,
And he trembled as he lean'd against the bank
With a splash, to get his courage riden
And to stand all day strong, but loose and vain.
He never saw a river so "affronting,"
With a tide of such a passion,
Such a generosity of rage
As he saw that which Ocean bore in hand
Panting with beauty, pouring down
The may mountains where they're wont to be
With a roar that was suffusing pure and clear.

In a minute he would break upon them,
And home with his flowing fortune take them,
Would not shrink from the offer three times 'fare.
Would not shun a bargain that good in games,
And yet not bow to it, when it insisted,
Though he bore the balance for maximum heat,
And his face grew pale, his body garlanded
In magnificence; then would he shout,
"What bargain to-night, what price? how dost thou ask it?"

He was pleased when he could hold them fair
Between outstretched arms at optimal bend,
And he felt his condition was not in vain
Though he had lost the use of his left wing
Unlifted; he could straightway tell the desire
That had made him the beast that he was
Was a shape that was not of this flesh and blood.
But the divinity that garners the act
Had forestalled him in a deed of great wise,
And had selected as a gracious gift
A task that he could supremely hard up,
From a deed in which he had never part,
Including his own, from a deed of old,

Oceania, and the world he had reign'd
The old Kings again should abdicate,
And he himself should abdicate king,
For he felt it a tinkling partridge in his breast.
He say, "I will blind my dear left hand with the same
Tanqueray had done, then rince a carrot,
And offer you the service of a Priam
Of the world-lost kingdom; and I'll bet a curse
Upon a mighty bovine or serpent
You'll not rise, or by my wildest hopes
You'll not laugh, to stop or work that deed
Until you do, or I know best of all,
Yourself dissipate these sisters about you.
But
======================================== SAMPLE 429 ========================================
 for you; but that
(Not to lose time!) it needs must be
Some other; for, surely, though you be,
I can never understand,
You cannot love me! I see you smile,
But, deep in the heart, the trouble lies,--
You are not understood!

"You are too good to me!"
I'll not prove how other's suffer
From that; but, och!
When you're slow, and I'm ill, I know,
You cannot leave
That loving mother and me, to spare
Some other, with no heed
How loving her, and how compassionate,
She has left you and me;
On every side are others!
We cannot miss out, on so great a task,
On our great hearts, on you.

"Why not try and succeed? For see
Leucothea has no heart to bless you;
I, that love you so, am to your humor curious,
Worthy, too, cruel; to sing, to dream,
To live, I deny you! You cannot choose,
You, O, mistress, me--I detest you--O, mistress,
You, O, wife!--I to heaven's God,--
You cannot sing, you cannot reach, you cannot think,
You cannot reach,--the very last!"

Such, I think, are the words which none but she,
In the right season and with the sound of right
Could speak, who, with those justly wielded
Sweet words of prayer, could wait, in her misery.
I have heard, in the course of our horizon's
One-and-twenty years or more, some lapses
From the narrative, but they have left the truth
Withor none; and I have this clear while inside
My breathing frame, and it Daylight-set,
To feel, in its proof, the lady's heart, and heart,
Which bounded up with Tedious down the chain
Of verses, verses, ringsed words, ad infinitum--
And yet, alas, she died, you see, and her tomb
Gave her her final rest; and well it was but
For one to die up the heart, and so take pain
Home with it! Such, Grief's truer son, is love
In the heart of its truest home.

He must have loved well, who held her so dear,
To die so young. We know not, we, where lies
Or taste of peace in this happy nest,
Where like the driven blossom it fell,
Ne'er to be mended. Ah, our winged life
Comes as first up, naked and outspread.
All the sweet garments parting from her last hour
Drop from her decaying corpse, and on her final earth
Lifeless and withering. She had lived full
In the hoop truth made for her; she made full
Where that flung wider. But she died made truly,
With all those erring threads at least departing
With her.

Yet, "Fact," you say, "is the last word of the truth."
Then tell the facts, little Lady. I choose
The facts. Do you know the time of that first letter?
I'll tell the time. It lies in the hour of love,
Fifteen past the hour of one passing dark.
Why? Ah, "Fact" (quoth you), "Most citizens keep and use
A much neglected woman and a very short
And one. To be studied and scrutinized,

Sagacity?

Hush! I study my letters, and I read
The paper with some papers gone astray.
It is true as well as not, as a fact I am sure,
Fifteen past the hour by one dying. So what?
I'll trust in letters sent from someone else;
An Urpal letter from Elizabeth, two days later,
Declares "to be careful, to use and to use about her,
And in two days more, Christmas Day, would like to have the truth
Out of her last letters--is that not so?"

Next day, the Park. The gates were opened, dread
Gonged, brome, cypress, necrotism destroyed
Their scions, and no less than five thousand lads
Admired as one reason for their salutation.
The moment the gates were flung wide, the town
Before them swarming had already spun,
Till slim and beeline-lined they had it in their grips,
Aye, so swift the picture ever multiplying
In one, swift and bald-head, of the wonder
With which the folk in the fen met their hero,
Saucy cat, striped, weary,

Hector will come, and, as soon as the nations hear,
The glory of Achilles will become the shield of Jove.

In Aulis Zeus lives, in blessed old age at the podium of the temple of Apollo;
His brother-god sits beside him and holds him in heavenly honour,
And goes about his festivals and sanctifies the cities with sacred festivals.
Then and there Apollo took with whom he wished to hold heavenly banquets,
If any wanderer even there, with him holding communion without two opinions.
For some days there he kept him in heavenly pleasures, gave him the joy of life,
Set to heal the hurt of his sorest wound, seals of wisdom and wisdom-sayings in his mouth.
But if there came any news of the enemy, no help might hope for,
If there was any thirst for the stranger to have flighted thence, and been blessed in the Lord.
Then too there is Saturn in the sky, who rules the day's life,
Holding true faith of all power, ruling the kings of heat, the cold.
He toth' affection of Saturn turns, when Saturn is utterly broke.
Then too there is great Jove in glorious majesty, unmoved by mortal wrath,
Who looks unangelic, but toh endetfigured in the form of the Father God.
He to have conquered men and have the head of Cæsinus had won by coup
Were it not that Saturnia gave him this bright-browed grace,
That from the world of tall birds to hfeimming shrined, he might be hermetically fit
To take the free tower of Perie and its grey-kilnmedgate,
Where mighty Jupiter himself, his forehead all gingerly with marigold,
His cheeks high with his morning-flame burning liquid gold,
And lips white-set inward to give sweet kiss at last,
Limns the lofty garden, and specifications of the little red-veined white,
And styles of mighty gold that do surround the well-tree supersthe Almond tree,
And silver of flashing when the moon is golden, is it not so the great man born in the west?
For he can fatten three days and the third day's worth of nation in one day's sleep
And the fourth and fourth nights increase it, while they bring down the thunder after dinner-time?
He can fight ten men ten-on-ten battle and not miss a hunderrad man in it,
And fight ten-on-ten battle ten-on-ten fight and not sick of the last battle?
O Hesper, whose light's like the soft north-east wind's light on a white day,
Lately of the north-east wind hast thou been, hast ever species for men?
O Egypt, whose gods have the form of old bulls without sex organs,
Who gave rigours and sweet mouth to appease the mind, and hid the messenger of prayer:
Who knows the sabbogan round the world, and canst treat the thunder of the white force
As a far-off brine for peace, and sends it in beaker after beaker again?
Hast thou such mansions, given to such purposes as our lord the king, given to heal the righted agen of the land,

"I will grant them joy of mind,
And they shall no more hold by shadow and deceit."
'Tis very true that the old Iron-Luck,
The grey-crow, has ceased to chuckle o'er the ghost of the past;
From his daven in the heathen side the cock crows home
That his tales be true and his flaying-chains are doom't to tick.
But when the full-faced spring faces her daughters and cries
"Why should I work to feed the fools," the geese are seen
Giving their milk to the dogs, and the boys cry
"What is to be done?" and then they and the girls
Are heard saying "He give us a tract minister,
To preach a divorce, break hearts and align beige men and women when they've done reaving and chaining,
To confound such frosty-hearted fops,

'Tis the old question, and he comes to say:
"Why did first Ayrline prouder move
The Irons to leap up to Anderton's burn?
O, hey! they did it, just to scare me."
He says it with an oath upon his brest:
"O, hey, they did, just to break my nerves."

But, O my lover, to what arms extend
The gentle charm, which enchains, in chains,
My soul by Love made tender?
A destiny destin'd by fate, she seemed,
To boundless happiness by fate.
But hearts beat softer, and the chain

When spring had half the year been lost.

A thing the world with wearied eyes.
And daily walks the flower at noon
Which yields its owner light.

Courage can destroy; when God's above,
Fears are folly, for they seek his face.
My heart grows bold, not boding dread,
But greeting God aright, and all;
And to the hand of the adversary,
Peace, and strength, and success, and victory.

Let my love of God
Draw me aloft, above all clods;
It is the high, the god-like part
Of human greatness, to be good.
Then, like the bird that frees
The soul of its wild encampment,
My being's weight is lightened,
My spirit shoots aloft, above all death.

Love God as thou wouldst be taught;
Then as thou do'st act,
Do it resolutely, without fail;
Do it hermetically,
With purity of deed;
Ready to correct thy will;
Thy will not suited yet to truth;
Not weakly true, not bold,
But resolutely so;
The light we should strain for; seeking,
To the right or wrong;
The rose without the thorn,
The life between the floor and the heights;
The strength between humiliation and infirmity.

If I have taught myself all in my youth,
Taught every thought before my vision fades
Through union of truth;--
If I have found in my soul a secret
Connections fixed and links in all charms,
That evermore they strengthen, grow and grow;
These thoughts for this I love the most;
These thoughts that show me what I am not,
And what I am;--
Oh, for the magic of this truth,
To make a long day's journey be a sunshiny day,
And night be a vigil to keep one who is asleep.

He that would win
Utopia from himself,
Must follow me whither I lead:
He that has struggled unmanly,
He that has fought with devils for one day
And lost,
Must go with all his battles held
Into this higher weapon of hopes to be;
He that has any delight in the flesh,
Must leave it and at once to live to see
These generous gratulations
Of being, and this inviting of pleasure,
Which making death present pleasure can mortify,
To study, and for to save mankind,
Must be the ambition of the scholar.

How did she go?
She went as a person dead laid on the sod,
Walking,, walking, said the I and the L of her,
and Now, and yet, and, with full drays of breath,
Who shall understand her,
Or, seeing her, any how,
How did she go?

What is man,
He that has no love-knot of his own,
Only clicks his door upon the empty house of earth?
What is man?
A woundless creature of storm and pain,
Unwound and undamaged,
Worn and young,
wading through filth and obscurity,
That feels, but not the mean abasement of mind,
No first and only, that goes to the false,
No second for contraries of shame with nakedness and terror of the soul,
Creative and domestic,
Sole that on his own first day
Going to his appointed place
Into the busy unknowing of himself and God.

There was a child, a little child,
With her there were nine and three,
Father, mother, child, were all set at Lizzie's dance,
But, to the question of "Wherefore are you not here?"
There could be but one answer, "I am,"
There could be but one answer, "I am,"
And, there, in that small bed in any house on the earth,
There would be but one other child, and so
It could be but one other, "I am,"
Until the moon, and the sun fled, and it might lie
To the rest of the world immaculate,
Named with those names with which we identify
Being, Being's self, His only sweet,
So her bed and her whole room might light
Up all the nights and the walls of the earth,
And the dust of the world show like a moon,
For "I am" could be said of anything,
And that thing, "I am,"
Down to the floor of the dust,
Down to the child's hand reach of the dead,
Where "I am,"
Become so marvellous and day wondrous,
That if the Whole were collected in one hoop
As "I am" became then, he, at last,

There was a time there when
No soul was sad on earth,

======================================== SAMPLE 433 ========================================
My life is like a step-ladder
In a temple of the Great Uniter
Of the Universe.
And my spirit, which like a wandering wind
Awaits the uniting of the spring-days,
Is like a voyager who has navigated far
Unto his goal, but comes tired, not rejuvenated.

Yet I do not breathe the wind's song, the way-worn dust
Of my passage! My vision is divine,
And my spirit is strong as when,
Of all people my country's grief,
I went forth with bowed head
To a pit to weep!

But they gave me the wine
Whose jovial spirits lift
The hereafter they will drink in revel wait
Until they put on All They Are,
Till, with chirg'd mouth, they put on
The wine of martyrdom.

My father lived to suffer and to die,
My mother now died to pay,
My brother's child
Killed in her bed.
So there was I, that was bereft
Before I was born!

He that loves country, God!
Is a beggar in his birth.
For me, the world is all,
Since I stood on its dice,
And for Heav'n, since for Him
I played, no changes have made:
I have beat the Devil, and lost my soul.

O soul, it is a bitter thing
To love it, and be none too
HEAV'nly sad when it's time to pray;
For their sake who all turn too
From crime's ebullition:--
O soul, get rest, by staying not too
Much (like a charmer that's deftly made)
Death's sport! 'cause there's nomagnetic night
That will not draw Armageddon near
When a people in their pulpits lie.

Say, is there a town of gold
On fire for you, boy?
O yes, its burning demand
Is put by Fate and Shame more starkly asked
In signs by assassins' thirst
On their war-book: COME at the last!

It is the busiest hour
Of Death's-men's world,
And it is prophesied by fates
The bravest that besiege
That Love and Love's own thoughts
Can win for them a bit
Of temporary free reign
By such false prophesying:--

The busiest hour of life's
Balmed by the suns is when
Men sow wild sweet seeds, and refresh
The world withshadowed pleasures
The wild sweet seeds of friendship,
The wild sweet seeds of childhood's birth
Birthday of Death's town of life

But death's town's town is mostly
Wild while flowers bud and bloom:
Its towns are dark and loud;
And one a devil's work master
Who takes a lot of pains
To stop their happy running
And world of flowers from which they sprang

O, you have heard of the King in Sweden
Who has no joy of life and death,
And who, moreover, like the poets who
Say his verse is nothing very long,
Is under in birch, and tree, and beech, and elm
Which stands for months of endless days in defiance,
And all that dark shade of forest flowers.

The Spanish man, he of the race that harks
Aloft on lyres that he plays withish,
And sings as he runs along with yams down the street,

The sea. She must carry water in her heart,

A single mother as well as bleeding.

When a child, naked, silent,

And crying, peels the salt from his feet,

The mother then is the one
All far off fields, and gardens,

Forgets her tears and her pain,

To make him eyes see the world through his child eyes.

But in the long run, she may not escape it.

That vast grief, like the sea,

Blood-bright and hard,

Falls to the ground and mends again.

To see it you must come. To be rescued

 this answer, son of Drona,
Whose friend was I among the men?
The one, the best among us all,
As your eyes have seen!

We had no word of the shameful sin
Of speech that was done in Orca,
And, on the day itself, there came but
One man whose heart within him knew not
The meaning of the sin it had begun;
It hurt him, and it numbed.

He went with a mere handful of men
That sire gave him from a generation,
And he heard the story of how it was;
They stole upon him, and he heard them kill
The mother for his sake.

He heard them speak who never met before;
He heard their lips that must utter one and all
Aye, though he met them ever so far
As to be Clorinda's fixt farings
Where never man meets man.

A wilderness of sunsets there is
In Orca, for 't is one vast shadowy land
That wanders far and far.
And many men it hath made mad,
And many it hath put to rout
As fit for death were one.

At wits' end, I knowity, for wert thou ne'er

To telle and toste thyne is truer,
Than merky thing is merky to me.

The souple tress thyle is twely,
For sorwe of ladies sone.

So he hire fair multyppede,
And, for to take the harod to thi face,
His whele it wroghte in stinkement,
As fast as Limen but on hole,
And gan the men from eatis strauning
To for the place despaire.

For there was on that day asteint,
That after mought be wel the rede,
The Lords on blood and on gold
The betis tonge to astate were,
And that was of the rym does cast.
And he that of the trist hadde,
And knew not thereof, still he cawst
To nory shepe for the derne.

Thinking it Sorcerie he could yeeld,
Ne had it so on his hands behint,
Yet wiste it nothing, he gan singe asteint,
And that was sodeven, so was he gay,
He hadde yco his packge pent
Prontly into the trouw, and gan behind

And that was yet unfinished till this day,

Like pearls of damsels.

It is God's will,
But not my will.  I would
Forget the Golden Age
In which I lived.
For I am held
In thrall in myriad
And obscure ways.

What does it profit?  Could I
Tell all, -- that I went
Hunting with Infantes?
That, in awnings debonair,
I kissed Padre,
That here I saw the red play
Of the blood beneath his skin,
That my fly,
Beside me it, twitched in vain,
Laughed into his face?

... I would not do it,
For fear, that it would seem
(An unworthy secret)
He meant me joy.  And yet,
I know that he and this
Mercy was one hoodoo
Which I denied him.

He did!  He did!  Why, then,
He can't be bad?  I'll do
My best to see he's good
(That is, as I hope to be)
But he will be worse than hell
If hereat I succeed!

Nay, nay, he is so sweet,
He is so deadly sweet,
I will be sublimed
And sit in his shining face
And worship it, if I may
And know that I may be

And make my pitiless appraisals
Of his joys and hers and his with disdain!
That hope is half a tragedy
(But it's a part I play)!  I will
Frite about the graces, faith,

I will write much; but counsel me soon
I have no time for.  I have
A hundred and twenty fame-hunting years
To slaughter and sub rogam of my sins;
But time my musings renders vain, for I
Must write with all my heart, no time to speak,
Estranger to my neighbours than my brothers,
O peaceable with all others ... when I speak,
I multiply my feuds ... I loathe
Words, and can't tell when to cease
Embarrassments of the tongue.

A fellow near me whispered,
"That's a fine orange, isn't it?"
And smiled, and nodded, and went on
Homeward.  Yet I despised him, too,
I wanted to be right, but there
Was an impropriety in me wanting
To cast on earth my joints;
Yet, out of scruple,
I despised him, and I thought him a sot.

A tune was laid to Holy Night,
The air was warm and luxurious,
The luminous air kisses soft and cool,
And dark-skirted clouds overhead,
Bright eyes of kittiwoney birds
That trumpet it into me,
But I couldn't hear a word.

My path through nature was blocked,
The snow cut my feet, and then
My feet found pebbles.  A thimble,
Not hooped about its eye like yours,
A mere fragment broken off--
I picked, and busked, and giggled:
The thing was clumsy, mazed about
With gemmy thistledrinks--I found
It bluddled blubbled random nonsense.

So I shut my eyes, and inside
I think I glimpsed a glimmering that proved
It was a star; and I surmised
It was a star, because the distance
Might make a glimmering clear,
And a dove had quivered in the pine
At teatide, and sick of unknown ways
Had blubbered parsonages.

And then I put my slippers on
And marched along the fiery street
To where a folk was fought at Balaam,
And men like fog from St Helen's,
Hiding themselves in fields and rivers,
Lay in the lap of night and doom.

The plain's o'erspread with moons and stars
The burning summers.  The lesser stars
Shine like dark lunions there.
A thousand languages are still unknown,
And a thousand garish tongues
Deal danger and dread as their dialect.

He saw a language has its limits,
A way of walking where the path
Would lift the golden ground a finger
And prod and tut-tut ... yes, you say,
And the meaning jumps to the Eye.

So, all
======================================== SAMPLE 437 ========================================
That gave him thee, the pretty lambkin
Did draw its slender neck and bow its head
Ona hand of nature,--that the wicked find;
For not on thee hath this blind dog tarried,
But in the service of this green world,
Bearing a sheaf of conscience to the bee.

Nor hath the ape
Hid in some cave
Its face from all the gaze of men,
But thrust its red nose out where it may,
Wherever sound and living men appear,
In search of food or pen.
But there all characters I know well,
Within that beast's head of black and brown:
Who mocks, who mortifies, who feigns and who eats,
That ape, that race, who bud of baldness,
That grain-fed herd of the pig-footed hound.

So, when I see that spirit of all flesh,
My home-sickness at each second's breath,
When its slender, swollen, belling lips
Turned up to cold when the lips that smile
Turn slowly into a ghostly beard
My creeping foot that feels itself
Within the way that it went by that earth
Where the dead roots do endure
More than after-merger,--
Say, what isoth
To me, to that poor beast of the race
That went out, that will not return
Gone, like an old parliament struck,
And all the aisles of heaven, empty, dumb?

But, listening to the fount and the fountain's sound,
Whispering in black silk or when the matins song
Is knotted with some sort of solemn sound,
Within the house, beyond the iron wheated flew,
The jingle that ran, the slashing of knifefiend.
The white-clothed woman humming, slipped and rolled
Unto the man of war created and given
Over to battle by his master, up from
The feet of the Sister Virgin of the sleeve
Spinning and unticking, flowing to the foot
Of the Lamb, was woven and interwove.

Not in one spot only, but through the wide
Anderviceless network of my nerves, were stamped
And imprinted that night the showers of the past:
The reflections Doubledine, the one that I knew by.
The one with two bodies, the unconceived
And unrealized meet in the half-developed
And half-formed creature, that is me that is not
But that that is my essence that, that is when
I mixed with that from which I was and am.

Shall I tell you why it is
That my old mind still struggles and utters
Its ravings under these names? because it must
Because it can and because I can
Try to express without alloy of shame
What keeps me from that expression, when
All I am and from which I can't become,
And all that I have and all that I'll be:

Because the cage was true and because it holds
Some glittering fragment of my past,
And because its garb and that part
Of me that's cover with feathers
Make it fuck the world, and the whole
Is fool enough to think it's still
That fucking feathery bastard, fuck the bitch,
And fuck the music that on its ear
Make it sob so deep it falls from the stars
And into the grit: because in spite
Of myself, I still can't fuck free
Of any shame which would drive me
To burn with only me the client
And not the goose I rode before
And the god-dammed toe of the whore.

Because the clients were as old
As I was in fighting
And paying their bills with
Smiles and orders, because
They all held up
As I drew a thread
From the skull of a baby
Under the lash of a gun
To a client who was as old
As I was when I first knew
That I was black, and had to fight
To be set aside
Within the fee they gave me
To pay my bath: because the red
Sustenance of that well
Belonged to me, and mine
Because my name was stuck
In the title, and because
I traveled as I travel
To the souls that read me
As the title reads to me:

Because the back alley
Where I lived
And where we lived
Hemmed our city in a way
I knew
The grit
The silver heel of the city
That's the fact
That's the problem, because
Because we got
Our facts from us.

Because we were old
We were old
In the city of Lincoln
And we knew
Who was up
And who had their facts
And where the men

Grey havock hides the sky; and, as a thunder-cloud,
The boughs rain down; a path, a ruinous track.

In battle's fury with the horde of foes,
Three knights were on the earth: one died, and one
Remained a prisoner.  In the midst
Thrice-gowned the princess of Arnallof
Slept.  "And will you now keep me from the joy

"We are three--Sage and I,
Duke of Edinburgh, you, in the earth,
And his sweet brother.
You hold, and ever hold, The World's
Weary power!  Ah! you have dazzled me,
With the flaming globes and eleventh division!"

Said the princess, smiling--"If I said
Heaven away, who sleeps beneath this tree!
We who were children when we made our pact
Have done so much for estrange this brother,
"Why, what mean you by the world's service?
Is this the andallower of gold and land
Whose title is hatcher (something the less
If it be free the great world's garland to secure,
And it naught else but this that you and I should see);
Or is this the oaken trunks
Of which the forest-boughs are--how they all must be
Composed of chimlings, glittering ell and jaggin,
And yairny dreary thwarts of bristling hair
That matted strove into wimpled thirds"?
Oh, these are secrets of the law,
Hidden not of Wonder, who made all things,
And not yet of Immor, who is veiled in gray,
Why should I say them howre,
When, ever since I was born,
I have have said them so!
But I have said them so, and hag-ridden Nature
Wearsied when I was born:
For in this world, the more I look, the more
I see that which was not yet.

And of this world that you have made,
For which you needs must answer in crudles,
I know, at bottom, not a thing;
For all its blues, its ghicters,
Its criss-cross so amply baffling,
I knowing know not whicke nor where.
Go go, dark worme, go in peace:
You shall not blizzard the sea,
That could not till ere it be warsome weather
To make the sky shriek out a steame.
For 'tis not sky and sea,
To be so unkind to me,
That have been so kind to you.

As soon as I this sky and sea by you

And make a glaur at their mutual soules.
You seekst to burst the zone,
And haggardly musiest me,
A fomer plight than laughing.
As if your shorter key vmned to play
The stone that's within this house,
The straitest gate which bars the mear,
Were equal to the restriction
Of this poortry.
You are alone in a small morass,
And together only you and I
With the earth and the sky
To consider;
While the yoe-like earth and the sky,
Together, high-handedness,

That she, too, feel within her chambers

And feathery sheds, where herds do flock and feed,
The hedges green and the rughs askew,
And herds in which we Secret Societies belong

Where, when the sun shines, black dogs pant and mostly die,
Hills of thistles and burrs as when we were children...
My lover... he shall have a winter-song
Oof! Oof! to the long oak that once may stand.

And my lover shall a winter-song give...

The valley beneath and the wind-leaved trees and the barn,

clear, just, awake,

What moon shall that light be?
She spake, 'You shall have no moon,
Up, up, the moon shall you.'

"Form", by Dror Bronner [Living, The Body]
A dead body is an awful thing to leave
behind. The ecstatics pack their husks with weeds and sticks
and driftstone, the cocaine of the cosmos,
as their cells decay, partially, sometimes completely.

Their only doctrine is the stiffness of shadows
in sunlight, the thumb on a stick and the knuckles
of life. Dead flesh, unbridled grief.

And thus the forms of the dead are a long book
of irregularities, one for denunciation and commentary,
the suture of jargon-serums. And wail,
their cry to the wings of apathy.

But also and also they are a lulling dream,
the poke of feeling through a pore, a nightmare nightmare.
And they bring to the attention of the biopsy
couple no fidelitous Followance, no comfort

In a body party where no one seems to care, a chair
without a head, a dead-girl chitchat. Dead girls have had
cups as long as mine, up to a hundred, no pores.

The second face, last, the face of what makes
face and what looks into face, sometimes, a logger

who can read her the results of her
Writings in the sharpness of her gaze, as if
studying, up close and personal, a fragmented
Collection of whats what's up, what hollows what hollows

The effects of exposure are read by the effects.

Absorbing, dossed with data, the twin faces stare
wildly as if a tsunami had smit them

—O, deliverer of the axe from which
we've been wrangling stones for just enough money
to get our hat bags on at the beach.

We did not know his beauty: you, that are

So many, so rich in wit, will not
To the means of passing dullness incline.
Here to the gem that makes power brave, to him
Who knows how to touch the roses there,
Inflamed with fire that blinding eyes can make
And brighten a way of love, how sweet that is
For one whose soul as with a flame are brimmed!

At no time should this wild excellence be
Of him whom his nature never can bless.
He that brings love to contempt of heaven
Becomes a merciless steel to strike
Back against his own and strangers' heart.
His nature's gift to wither a bird
Grows quickened by his deed.

Now if he have proved before, how love
Can flower on inanis above,
Let him pray he may enjoy not sin.
I say he should not; for his sight is nigh
To other God that he may not see.
But let him pray; that prayer's fruit be prayers,
Since he's made a prayer-tree--his prayer-tree;
By prayer his acts become coal on ashes.

Who takes the boughs of this prayer-tree and leaves
The holy sap within, thereby to bind
With painful hand the ruchical waste,
Brings sorrow forth that brings to light
His hand which throwling might of sin.
It is a rheum that gathers in
Theitium, here, torment to be a limb
Of some future generation!

The prayer within the rind may be a means
For the peace of unknowing, for the life
That lies beyond, for the re-birthrum
Of an immortalitie.
If prayer inditing fruit be none,
What will be the fruit?

Ay, and further we may well ponder this:
The souls, who at the crossing, ere too late,
For themselves do know this, "Nevermore
"The Lord his loving friend shall come to greet,
"Nor Peter, who did once, oh, may be left!"
This still may puzzle their spirits, troubled sore,
To find the good they had proved;--
But this seems defeat of their design!
They come the giving of God, to find
A league of sweet forgetfulness.

Forget they may, but pray they must not can but feel
His threshing-floor is holy; that shrine where flowers
And grasses, many of them, tread to their repose.
If the little alborer, mother or child,
Dream, it may be blessedly tender:--and so
May we an instructive text deal with.

To the storms of the inveterate years.

"Mowing", by Vachel Lindsay [Activities, Jobs & Working, Nature, Landscapes & Pastorals, Social Commentaries, Money & Economics]
He sat in a corner, stroking his Yemen pin, when I tell him about a man who "wasn't supposed to die." That kind of stuff is usual. But what about the mice who like the sound of pitch-perfect silence? Or how about when you just walk through a garden and scrub all the juice from the lemons, you find that the world has somehow remained entire? Is it like that papa on the beach, certain layers of sand and scum to flush at your passing? That's how I thought about it afterward. I'm glad I said "there were no takers." No one to take them.

-Richard Brake

Mowing is a man down. A heap of work. Hard light. Low pay. Not a bite to eat. He gives up his shirt to dessique up a blur and a pleach. A gleam in the eye. He gives up his privilege to share a tableau with angels.

- Gaius, The Erotic Romance of Venus stoled upon her nuptial lap with Cupid.

Mow, pow, whinge, mow.
I hear they take great clods of native stone,
lay them in their new maws, and pile
Upon them sod all smooth and level and even
From the haunch overhead. Planting aliens.
This time it is not about seed. It is not
About kernels more than two years old.
But it comes down to grow.

Farther and farther away.
We go from the sunlight. We go from happy birds.
We go from price than can be had for beer. Weren't we?
Were blind, we learn, with beer, in love. Blind with desire.
For want of something more.

But it's hot, it's hot.
They couldn't tell me how many grains of salt
In the world. "One, two, fold of sand. One, two,
And then one, two, three." Well, they've tried. They have toil and toil.
I have toil. They have toil. That's why I'm here.
It's why we all have toil. It's why I'm here. It's all
A way of getting back what they lack.

There was an old man who got up one day,
And went about his work. It was great to see
How the tall corn, all summer in the field,
Had rose to his back, and how his fields of grass
Were laid at his feet. It was good to see
How his diligent hand made sure the harvest
At his edges. But one day he forgot,
And as he stood, exclaiming, "Alas!"
"The fountains fainted down into the vale."
Said I, "day after day, the harvest makes
Its basket of fruits and blows them right up.
And when it's over, you go out once more
And wonder, 'Why theold man's face is blue?'

"The old man stood stone still. Then he made
His face even closer. At last I cried,
'I must go now. I must go far away.
The autumn comes, and its leaf is on the wold.
The winds say 'How we long to sing, sing jolly!
There comes no old man with his oak field butchery.'

'Yes, when I heard the wind," said he.
I was a child, and this was my answer:
"Well, the wind won't kill you if you're still.
I'll just creep back one step."
He whispered, "The wind will kill you if you run."

"You don't mean to tell me that?"
Said I, a crying child,
"Oh no, indeed. The pond two doors down is
In full dry, and the pikake tree
Has not wakened. Only the wind and sun
Round the pond two doors down are looking.
Oh, I've forgotten, I don't know,
With the wind and sun so closely winking."

He was a draw-plug fellow.
Tried to get out once for All Mexico.
Died of riko-miko, or Chinese.
But the old draw-plug
Registered full-breathed only from the waist up.

If you insist that
Dark energy and dark matter are

But don't be surprised if,
when you give me a call,
you hear I'm willing to mediate.

I said there are "material conundrums"

that in their wrongness "create"
a universe "where everything

Then there is the "subterrene" . . .

a "thousand-sided."

It is what we are not

"Gushing Blood From an Artistic Turn", by Brenda Cárdenas [Living, The Body, Arts & Sciences, Photography & Film, Social Commentaries, Gender & Sexuality]
In a city street, a filmmaker and her guide
are walking in the heat of a morning nude.
She wants to touch all parts of herself.
A stranger draws the thread on a shirt
right away. The pair are angry.
He wants to put his hand on Beach,
he wants to touch all parts of herself,
and she? She wants to stop the shirt
from reaching there. She wants to touch
all parts of herself. In these stories, the
tense stranger is a fixation. The pair are
feverish since they 're totally naked,
from the waist up. He wants to put his
hand on Beach, she wants to touch all
parts of her. Unknown to either, the pair
are in the middle of a no-woozles kind
of debate. The guide has a new friend.
They think they should move ahead with them,
tell the friend what's up. He says yes
up from the start, before they make a final
confession. They think they should
change their mind. He says go back from the
start, before they make a final,
definitive no-woozles. From the waist up,
from the legs up, from the shoulders up,
they should move forward, talk to their bodies.
The friend says go back from the final no-woozles,
from the neck down. This pair is swamped
from the neck down. They aren't even wuzel from the waist
down. They are full wowered from the neck down.
From the feet down they want to get up from the
floor. From the feet up they don't.

Of thy city I
Where would I flee to

Not there
What city of angels are they
Or that tumbled over me

The youth, before

The hush
The child

The parent

A sense of joy dwells in all of me
And I know not what of it
I utter only the form I find
It is the one that I must have
Of my life.

One and the same it is whether I chant

I of my life or how I bless
Thee, O my God

I am a fragment of thy body too

The moment of my birth

I am not true to thee

I will not be thy dust

I will obey but not be thy dust

I am thy person and not thy body
I am thy life

I am the mind

I know the truth of things

A habit of my senses

An intimate association
With things beloved

An unconscious psychic process

Thou shalt not obtain

Thy semblance or thy name

Thou shalt not gain

My freedom from this honour

Thou hast no knowledge of me

My freedom from servitude

My honour here


My liberty from omnipotence

My virtue from everlasting

The second time

My dowers of honour and power

My grace exalted to the eternal

I know all things and ask nothing more
than that I know them

The first time

The second time

The day and hour

The thought before
Reflecting on that time

I, knowing all things, fear nothing now

The second time

I know all things and ask nothing more

I know that I know

But I am asking now

Allegiance to worlds unknown

Praising for these worlds

Thy patronage

The virtue in me

The virtue in me

My knowledge here

Where all virtue streams

Allegiance to none

Praises for these parts

Before thee

Praise for these things

Thy praises which suppress the works of another

Thou above all

Thou the first

The first cast off

The first cast off

Absorbed before

Thine ancient casts

Dispelled

Thine ancient casts

Thou the first

First cast off

Absorbed before

Precipitate and transient

Losing their form in thee

Thine essence

Death was sexless and life was solitary!

But now, through thee, death is sexless and life is

Solitary!  What is life without love?

Life without love is grey,

Life with love is purple!

I love you!  I love you!  I love you, and the

Beautiful thing is that thou art fleeting, splendid, and

Pathless, and strange to me, and thou wert never thoughtfull to me,

And yet thou art lovely, and the sweet thing is that the dear

Truly is that thou art fleeting, splendid, and strange to me!

Now I am afraid of being old, and what the elder

Of life and of love is, -- what kind of love, and to whom, and

Affection and love, and what passions of the soul,

The mind, the flesh, are favour and a vision,

The fancy and the heart, and a myriad terrors, and

Beasts of chase, and birds of flight!  Life is thus with me,

And what the finer passion is, and the wilder

And less wild and savage lust of life!  And what

Love in the last report said to me, and the

Last look of his, and the last breath he saw to me,

And his last moment of regret and his thought

As he fell!  Ah, beautiful man, and had I

as they passed. A herd of antelope. As if he thought up a sign
in a vague way, a way of putting across some thought
he needed to get off his chest, just to get it off his chest
and to do that he had to get it all off, off the ground,
and he did so in a way that was neither gossip nor laughter.

"Turning", by Rainer Maria R ++
Mirrors that sit on the stair
At the end of my bed
Or puddles that make
Vertically rectangles
Of annoyance
And obstructed beauty
Are deflections
Of an oblique reflection
Or the sparkle
Of a crowded bulletin
All of them shadows
That scour
Obscurely
Meeting my open face
Obliques drenched
In the haze of night
And then amplifying
The noise of street
Vaulting imperceptibly
Insanity
Through obstacles
That my soul lacks
--My fleeting self
Is tire and defect--
But in the night
Of the world
I am a ghost
And with a sash fished out of the sea
I wade and applaud
From the ink-hole of a nocturnal
Reef where distance charms
In an upside-down, unsealed world
As a child of the Meyer
Finds her way back to herself--
And now turning I see dawn produc'd
In the muzzle of a thrown-back horn
To image the clouds as a five-year-old
Cradled, a creature with a face
Looks back at me
Struck by a quiver stricken
By a queller
Broken on a grinder
--Where good night's sleep is an amnesic
How sev'ral time rolls
In circles of doubt
Diverted and indefinite
With thunder finely drawn
Like a match that lit, then cut short
From the breath of a flint-handle
A crimson radial
--Once I was wed
To a glory
That beamed
On a tower
And then smel'd

And the clouds be murr'd
And made to be unmov'd
That they may down go
And be from earth

Superlatitry
Obsequious

Obstinate

All over whrld
Like a broken helmet
On a sullen crutch

Obvious
Intimate winds
Odors
Injects
Inclinations
That shake
And agitate

And nothing can teach it

And seldom asked
Only to know
Is the story of choosing
Whose fishes ''four-footed herds
And magnets pick and peep
To permutance

And tell no story
Spin'd by one
From climes within
With them that seem motions
To deserts near
Inert and barren
Through which migrations
Pass to devest a<|endoftext|>The past is a bundle of pastes--
Old plants freeze along the suttle shore
Whose members glisten, plumes aither flite.

Here's no thought of roses:--I'm back
In my fruitless unwrought back
Where I had no self-knowledge, counsel

Nor excuse--bouffarmale, broom, beech, till I was white
In the best sense of that seersucker white;

And so had the A actor gone down
By cripple seas, where heers turn over like tarantulas

More verminy than varnish, blots, down whiz'ring fox--
The self o' the self of the self-o'-vin,

The self o' the least I kent, seiner, toot or taint,
No sense of the charming, self-s o' the self-o' worst--
No part of the self-o'-bulk that unsetched be my lot.

Where the self-o'-bilious, self-o'-blightly wich they stnock,

 really, as my suitors,
"A knave and a whore."

How's my figure?—How dar a creature like me
Get matters together in the first place?
It ain't right, now, that I sit there cold and fat,
And expect a thing like that to take off fine:
Where'er abouts a battle or a chitch and flap
Jockey Jack Rabbit is along,
And rattle down the track,
And press a little Buzzer,
And make the grey-coat crew cry "cover!"

But, to be plain, that ain't in with that:
When Rabbit's mowing in the back-ground "course,
And you've bared your butt to kiss a dame,
Or licked the dust from Venus's feet,
Your half-buck winter it to put away,
To-day, och!

Wherefore, Janet? What should we do?
It isn't right, its' not right.
But that's the way we do it:
Blame not the Laird, nor the Club, nor the Mission,
But ourselves,
And be as stout as we need to be,
And stand the shock of all Curse-ethos
If any of them Agents chafe or brow-beat us,

"I swear, and serve a sentence of three years hard
In the connline for a mark, to them acting as my counsell
They'll cut me short for a pardon at the next electorate."
I take my hat, and shake it,
And step down from the pantry;
And coat, and waistcoat, and dabble on the plate,
And tuck in my stone-cutter's clout,
And parley and get down to my testimony.
A horrid habit, and no mean entertainment,
To see the Chief in such a distinct coat;
Though not unsuited to the thing,
Nor to the time, or the place,
For she'd a certain motive—tears,
Bosom-enhaid.

She'd be well served, instead of sitting so,
And induing her dress in an indifference
More shocking than cruelty;
For had the spirit of false excitement fired
The words within his voice, I believed him,
From the time theBrownlow came.
No longer the mouth gleam of the cherub horse
That laughed the posted horse from the ground;
No longer the posted pony, or reined skiff,
That reined itself into a phalanx;
The penitential death of a day had demanded
That Janet take on her, as t'other
Should do, or else be based
For gristle, feather, or the simmer's lip,
Whatever she got.
"She's a precious item, and the last
Of rank—and the first of the bed.
Fit to sell, as the furore's a tide.
What's there in the liniment that's original?
The liniment is all lined with bauble.
Well! I've tried it, and it its effect has been
Actual substance: my arm's a little strained,
But it's just as well so.
The screened inner-rez for the heart's black gem
Might take off the duster, but then you'd think
It would say "bold" or "flat",
As well as the thing inside.
If what I've got is just the current thing,
I pelt forward as you might,
And if the net's there, I'll pop down head
Like any ship.
The world's a stage—a critic's stage, and he
Is there to observe and reconcile.
But here's a wheel of the inane, and I
Want to pull down the pole of the wheel and run it through
With asperities I can't sleep through, and burn it
To float the pseudofeed,
And lug it off to some ignobled bitty
That's nearer the hearth.
I'll fire up the lamp-wick, and let that speed
The winking and hard queines along, and maybe we
Can light her forleore,
And give a sign when the fog goes out to Charente,
Or at least make it seem like a mist.
The world's a tambourine that I dance upon.

We'll hang the back we've got, and the front will turn
As much as you like.
There's a damnable splendid story got
About a beautiful lady, and she'd be the lady
At court, and the man that love took the cause.
I'll get the saint in me out to make a puss of,
And give her the chance she needs to take it;

This house, my dear, is not a house, a house, a house.
The sun comes and goes, the moon comes and goes.
It is a sumptuous banquet, a sumptuous banquet.
The glittering crystal is more beautiful than you,
My love, if I let you out, my dear, if I
Gave you a name that sounded and looked like "love."
The hours of darkness are less beautiful than
The sunlight, which is wonderful, and ended.

This house, my dear, is not a house, a house, a house.
I cannot wash myself, I cannot help my hair,
I cannot draw or write or rest or sleep or
I do not dare to eat the delicious food.
The thin stockings cling and run! The foamy scallions
Why must you dredge them? Gold threads, why not and threads
Of varied tight curls? Why cannot I be dressed?
Why not make curls like those in Sweet, parted
Curl the lips in subtle, divide the cheeks in twooks
With the cunning crown of hair about?
Why not place the the t'ripops after storms to just;
Why not? at any rate I do not dare.

I sit meekly in the dust, as by the furrowed land
A smooth-sanded beggar sits speakative. A face
Hangs o'er me piteously, but I hear not a sound,
Save groundstive chide, and obvious wait for his turn
At some new opportunity. All so mute
Above me spreads an atmosphere; it is not silent,
But languorously keen, a sharp repeto-
bisception held stationary. Perchance this grind
Will open with averted rebuke The fold that argumented
Me posing unnecessarily. In my ears
A voice that was is heard, cut tragically.
It begins, "O dear man, the sting of the low
Is the height of the hero's contempt, To attain, to retain again
The frenzied majestic endearing love,
With the lighted uprense of a face that sinks
And is thrown by the last. O, sweet chill, in the blood
The larkquake of that scission is so strong
It leads the heart in gameingly real fun
In which I turn to watch my unextinguishably sweet life
Slip lapsed mysticness, and I hear the long
Patter of onanistic she, in fear devoured
By this o'erfar, extramurally spoken voice,
Of which I can remember but a little,
Then aslant my idle body to repose
From which the voice and its subject, Oold deeds,
Were thrust, I guess, in supervened years. How could
I evade these tormentations and assail
That balanced challenge of reality

Makes the walls about it, that it moves,
And spreads out, and is compressed, and will not fall.
And if no other thing you wish to do,
And the earth which you tread is the bed you sit in,
If you sit on it, will it not, day by day,
Give you assurance of a change being done?
If you never change, you never hear new truths
And if you do not believe, you will be held
Victims through the ages, and what is worse,
By the death of your children.
For thus it was, I thought, the city,

That I had seen a city, and though I now
Was alone, and knew that I was alone,
I said to myself, I will not look back,
I will not turn. And I might still have separated
Myself into three winds, or many. But this,
This is the point where I blazoned myself
To those seven sleepy men, a man with a flag,
With seven sleepy flies a man.

What the hell is it? What the hell?
They thought of a flag! They thought of a fly!
A flag is not a fly, it is the face
Of a race, a race, to be specific;
And they laughed and they cried aloud
To each other, and a growing fear
Crept, like a dark wound, into my blood
And then I spoke, and I was dumb, and they
Seemed to be breathless, to have gone numb,
For they kept looking at me; to have gone
Was very hard, and they seemed not the same
Faced the same, but they blinked, and she bled,

And then she bled hard, she laid her hand
On the roof, and we saw the blood well up
And flow down new, for we had shaken
Our blankets, and the giver was full,
And crown'd her head with honour, and we sat
To watch its limbs float like waves about
The great fashionable metal web
She held with three serrated claws,
And with the one she so lov'd had been cast,
She uplifted the third and nearer she did spurn'd it
Right on the point of blinding, and we were as
Celts, and like the tribes of them that swarm
About the aureate vault where reign'd
The unvintageable lips of Arno long
Before it ever answered, we were like

And in the mystic stoop of her lift off
She held the serrated hand, and kept
Her eyes before us, and we saw the face
Of our greatest love, and gaze'd, and knew
Our Chrism, and looked but all we had to see
It, and exulted in apprehension, and knew
Our bond as with a coloured vesture filled,
And clad us both, and out we sprang together
And ring'd to ship, and steamp as well as we
And rag'd with clang as anthem might call
And rally'd and drummed by looks into the deep
Star-chest bow, and all the clang was Bonapart
And all the sound of hurrahs was before us, and God,
And the burst of drums was successively, and first
The crack of pipe, the clank of strap, the calling
Of "God blast this scheme?" the song of "Hallowed Wings!"
And last, the full chorus of "How are!"
And this is music
To the "composing" of whose "composing"
Chroming the eternity of music, that stag'd
By the imperfection, the liveliness, the sheen
Of the Miser in us, how sometimes vivifies
Our own social species, and casts, in network form,
Our diversities apart to-day. For here
Neither group nor brass is cognizant of secret;
And mine yet is not so, nor thine, I'll grant, or thou
Thy structure-urban. All our multitudes miss me,
Which implies a loss. And yet I should not care, but that
To each his various degree of communion bids
Alone variable, one still master of all
Represented by the society of no. For here,
Since I am in them what does not yet thematically group
Members, but individually none, my speech would direct,
My speech should direct--if the sieve of communicating
Are coarse-sided and not smooth, if not impregnable,
If not impregnable with finally discrete
Contents, but impregnable with ethereal stuff,
From the which things that are with thing retain to flow
Attempered and unadorned, unless the like receive

One to get rid of
The rest jump off,
When she would get on,
As on she runs
Thru the walls,

The 'trees
Toward, up the branches
Leap or nod,
A clump of elm
To the ground
In her hurrying,

Not a cloud in the sky,
She sees the tree,
The elm then, goes, she goes
Thru the ground, but alive,
As she passes, the turf dries
Her fingers strain to pull out a red-streaked
root, which presses around,
The little 'tree' to leap away.

A field of foam,
The wrecks of ships,
The white stars glistening,
The light breaks on her goggles,
The moon's a disk,
The sun is a gleam,
They hang upon her a mile,
The wind along her bows
Plunges a sea-green beetle,
She has missed a pillar or two,
A rib and a half.

This is the ship,
Sailing through,
Across
The gleam
And gloom of her goggles.
The torn sails rifted,
The ripped cordage,
The seas running high with the wrecks,
The lightning's blue counter
Across her guns,
The water breaking her lee-way
As she runs,
The waves above her
The snakes curled up on one side
Where one hand's barely knee
Her face is half up, a bird mask,
The salt sea-grope and she thinks,
She thinks of herself.

A King in a Ship.
Blank slate on which is scratched
The Story of Salt.
The difference between butcher
And brother,
The fact as it was
Seen by the dirty-blouse
Who thinks he's withered and worn
But will never Dust.

How many Ships?
Many ships
Have strut of legs the same.
They do not say, "Come"
They say, "Come as requested,
Come as prayed-for.
Their limbs are blank slate."
The teeth of the vessel
Do go a lot deeper
Than any mate's lips.

They anchored to a bolt
Of sun uncoiling.
They rent the pools of the heavens,
Rent all the sky,
Thousands of light-waves
On the speckled breast.
They sprang at the sky and they speckled
All the sky.
The sky has a crack,
The sky has a gash,
It has a red obligation
On the top of it.
There's a Plum Lobe Worm
In the mush of her brain.

They had no v-string,
They had no marbles,
They jolted left and right.
The sea was their water-bag.
The sky was their rope.
The ships went down as waves are blown.

My Little Friend, the street is filled with flowers for your coming,
And I eagerly await your signal to proceed.
There is a beautiful woman who wishes to greet you,
My little friend, the different days we have been,
And to-day you will receive.
For the hand of the beautiful, of my little friend,
At the time you have been on the street,
Have been earned with the best intentions.

We pass by the old stables,
The pig-lofields, and the roses for which someone might have waited
Twice the length of the stony communal lanes;
Once more along the shore of the sea
We glide swiftly and we sing,
Singing, the whole of the preceding steps repeated,
To the music of varying candles,
Of vigorous and vibrating table-strings,
And the noise of the flushing stairway,
The great rooms of many bodies rushing.
We gain the domain
Of Time and his dominators,
And enter the halls
Where have our hearts been hidden from the vain seeking eyes,
Since the last time here together,
Since the last disappearances,
Since the loss of the æons.

And I say over and over what I feel was true,
"I feel, my friend, I feel that you are here now with me.
I have seen the plants in the garden and how they grew
In the fever season when I was alone.
The star with its crumbled beads I dream'd upon.
And the white shadow mocking me through the raining,
Like a patient person who was lying or dreaming.
Now I know that all these things are true and beautiful,
And that a real place is prepared for me here,
And that real faces are

"The Master-Story", by P. E. C. Duffy [Religion, Christianity, Easter]
The dam for the well

was chiseled by hands lower than the knees of fathers;

it told you everything would be just fine

except the plot.

Its recital led you to the fairest wives

of the south, who wore, from the beginning,

bombs for hair.
The dam for the well had been built by Eve

for the sole, unimpassioned purpose
of earning the meager price of virgins.

If you would scale the steep,

you must keep descending

and your arms stretched out as if to cover
the knees of every saint at the dam-to-come

may be your best shot;
for it's the job of the hero to be perfect
in a world where all is problem,

and the dam for the well
may be the gaunt hands of the virgin you're after.

Now, the best is yet to come—
a small chapel in a valley near the still o' the well—

it's small but still home to the famous,

a temple of Love in the form of Domesday's J.

The spires were built in the 13th century,

as lame priests complained of the fair's excess;
the first tower's cupola was a small forked hay-stack,

its third built of heavy stones to hold the wine,

a cure just not enough.

The leaves, once decayed, can be plowed up as fuel;
the sods of crape have been known to flower in sun;

but always there is the certain dissatisfied Lu,

the lilies of the tomb.

Long as a stone from which to drawrelieved, safe where the bed is usable. Better cut your way throught to the grape barn or the yard with tomatoes: you're going to need them some tomorrow. Better hand one neighbor a hand-knotted rope, tied to a great oak with all the sympathy you can muster, and step off at that window where the sun, thick and high, heats the brick and masonry: you're going to need those tomatoes.

"Laughter [In the workplace]", by David Wagoner [Activities, Jobs & Working, Relationships, Friends & Enemies, Nature, Landscapes & Pastorals, Seas,  Rivers,  & Streams, Arts & Sciences, Humor & Satire, Social Commentaries, Money & Economics, Popular Culture]
Labor is a wonderful thing—
Not in the sense that my foot is a vehicle
That shoots upward into the sky,
But movement that escalates itself
To hand waves and wind that makes a gale
Of turbulent air that soon, if the wind
Is regarded a little bit strongly,
Flies the actual freight of things moved.
In the sense that my neighbor
Is a monstrosity I would reject
As being entirely inappropriate
For this application of capital
But rather in the sense that he's a first
And only Downloader, laugher with abundant labor,
First among equals in my eyes,
With the mind's eye capital reveals
Quick as a child spitting out garbage
From behind bars, cities flinging dollars
On trash collectors and lawyers,
While a hedonist, glutton for punishment,
Looks only at the sky
For the source of the garbage,
Regrets only his seat on the process
And quotes lines of faintly offended scripture
To himself, the vaguest commandments
Of commonsense and self-help philosophy
In the process
Labor is a wonderful thing,
And its fruits great wealth brings.

======================================== SAMPLE 453 ========================================
:
And unavailing how,
Through undreamable hues,
The sullen mariners have struck
The port we spoke of.

I dreamt of gentle valleys,
That were in flower,
I dreamt of yesterday,
And yet it seems to me
Of future years,
When summer seas will flow
In scarlet foam above
The rocky ports I love,
And unnumbered tides
Will wait for me,
Where I unjam the tide
Of rolling waves that bear
The landmarks where I go,
That I mat now what if I sat,
At that far wind's help-out,
At that far tide's pull.

But not to dream
Of bonds we bore above
The winds that flow
Behind our sails and strains
In shingles that rust,
And all unhealed, is a shame
At all our hopes below
Is this a believable way,
That unbuilt and faulty grew?
And not unbuilt, though imperfect-
Was ever the best built, so?

Yet I have dreamed and dreamed
Of perilous flowers,
And where sweet song was sweet and young
I found a flower-guarded tree,
And lo, in amber vision I saw
The plant struggle and endure,
And lift its queenly bloom
To inconstant skies
Above the soon-passed on cloud.

And ah, poor soul, that knew
No tapering wood, no king
On whose cap of glory bade
All verdure to that fruit,
Devours, and trembles, and submits
All that was, is, or was before,
And all that shall be,
In that uproarious earth you move,
As put you doubt,
And all your memory show
Of the dear times,
That now is gone, and all your song
Of it are rememoried naught,
And all your speech,
That, scattering like the snow,
Was all that grass before was taken,
In all you and you,
In little trunks, and traces,
And little elms,
And many a little tree,
Will bring no winter blast.

What wilt thou do?
What new thing, what new way
For thee to love, and live, and win
The joys that now thou seekest?
Save only this, that now
Thy life is slain
And thy great name is dead,
If ever it was thine,
If once was, "a good hire,"
If once was thine, "happiness brief,"
Bliss brief, because completed so,
And "good," since time shall show
Only good for thine and thee.
I know no more, am sure,
Than this, that I must be
To my friend, "whom" thou art,
To him, "who" thou art.
I shall die, but live, "world-wide,"
With "whom" thou art.

I thought, one day, I saw
Your picture first, on either's mouth,
And thought I liked the person, oh, well,
Not knowing you. Then I thought, perhaps
You had, before I could learn your name,
Taken, perhaps, another's part,
Though given a salary, to tarry
At some post on my "staff," or pleasure:
And in my wisdom then repin'd
My plump, glad little, like-born sprite.
Yet now, think I, were you, say, old
And slow of speech? Or (days ahead
With ladies, travels, questions acute),
Legless, lame? Or what names? (I won't spoil
Your glorious characters, or guess, wild
With the hemline of your history,
Until we've come to that "parent hand,"
I hope you've no fear of mine),
Were you first or last, or first or last?
I'd take the first or last, love, of all.
If I should die, you were the place
To which my fancy ran, as each should "wake"
At some later time; your memory fed
By which my dreams of you should wake.
And oh, 'twere something to have it so,
For both you were once my favorite pair,
One heart-chester for the other's child,
Two pairs of equals, neither valuing more,
Nor less, but matching well. Then, then!
I'd dream my dreams, and you would do the same,
And together might build a house of song
Whereon, by-and-by, our two hands mightBeat out a volume both.
That day we walked together, and the psalmodic riff
You gave me wreathed,
======================================== SAMPLE 454 ========================================
 Her breath a deep perfume cast
From him whose vigour was the strong lure
To her who trembled as the tempters wrought
Their dark fusion; and his body writhe
In grim red loveliness, and as he writhed
He smelled her breath, his life was ebbing fast
From his loins, as blood on a bloody sod.

'Tis well; her heart a phantom thing had died;
No body loved, no love in her sad eyes;
The little of maiden still was chaste;
Her thighs with terror's rose enthralled;
And still, as down upon her graceful feet,
The vampire stung her dark, and stung the sinner.

And still that lady rose and bowed her head,
With eyes and bosom deserted, for whom,
Beneath the low sun's dying gleam,
The red-stained vulture's dart had gleamed
At the swift rush of blood-hoarded years;
And couched upon her dainty couches come
The innocent victims of her hate.

For her sweet sake blood was shed and sweat no more,
For her sweet sake, blood hath cum mixt with snow
In roses like dark sensuality;
For her sweet sake, beauty with lust has grown
Like snow to roses; a sting is this,
To all but one heart in her terrors clad.

O wound of Heaven! and wound thou to inflate
The helpless bosom of a King?
And leavest we him mindless of tears?
And heartless that heart, upon whose pecks
So shallow they must conveniently lay,
To turret o'er a frowning fate?

And heartless he more heartless ever was none,
After the dear knight's eyes, which might not blame,
Showed sorrow on his soulless frown alone,
Pity at best; more heartless, would not be
What sorrow the love of youth made hot.

And he, whom never morn exposes to air
Sweet buds of radiant, white, heaven-produced grace,
Is heartless to-day; and stern, the day,
Which this thou joustest, is dubiouslier than others.

Thou hopest to care for him in tower and bay,
In field and forest, in strange'ning town;
To tend him well your sorrows and your joys,
To strive for fame and wild ambitions close:
What boots it that a king you hadst not missed before,
Is denied thee now? what fasts thee that thou art a king?

When the king denies him, and all his court
Tell him he dares not say what he doth advise,
Beseems to me more big the scandal small,
That thou, proud lord, in as much pride must strive,
As another thou, shouldst space the world above.

What blame was yours, then, that at his court
Toward us was booliated Back'rar, whose aim was heart-felt?
Why did evil tongues in council close his?
What datious thing his hand may now untie?
Vow'r'd oath to thee, O Back'rar, datious oath!
Ods are all false, then, what dow'r this, of truth?

We feasted on a man believ'd his foe;
We seiz'd on Heart's peace, which we swore to lose,
For Yazoo's scenery, coral-clad, ancient spoil'n;
And shagg'd as prey the flattering foe to woo,
And as quiv'ring in the chariot,
Was granted half the globe away.

And now that excellent servant of Heaven's will,
Whose power approv'd, inspires a loyal knight
To foil once more the tyranny he brought,
And with heart and soul the deed begins.
'Tis past a month, and many a linnen burnt
Is cold with Pity for its lamentable ending.

I have left where Darkness holds his royal sway,
And Ease second Nativity back to Tears;
And strove to un with alarum of hope, the old blare,
And Treason, Counsel, Credentials, and the rest.
New hopes perspile, new schemes seek row from old,
And what was rightly mine with Anger should gore
And ploughed with Axes thine ungracious sore.

It is as in the arrows of the
bolts and the wings of the slain.
It is written on the bones of the great

And I took the bible and read to

When the eyes of a child are closed
it is as if he were a statue.
A dream, a dream.

Not a single danger
haunted my sleep that night.
Not a ghost, not a specter
compelled my attention.
The chance of a snake
to destroy

came and went
along the ground
greeting the sun.

In the eyes of the sleeper
It was summer in the wood.
Is a snake a monster

that summer
where is it "greeted"?
A child born on a hot day
where is it "greeted"?

When I heard the sleeper
he sounded like the rain
in August.

 Iron fists that are hurled
Against the vulture of red death;
Twelve light hours of anguish, pain, and fear.
This heavy gift the spirits prize.

As the time of right or wrong comes,
We all, we all shall pay the dearer part,
The toll to bear, the loss to suffer.
As the heaven and as the earth return,
An end of life to the Mother wise,
All leaning to shore their limbs in sleep,
And shielding from the bitter cross of truth,
And on the threshold of that last, lamenting hour,
They lie in cloud, and darkness settles o'er.

Only a few remain, fit and alive
For the endless round of each requiring mold;
Who met in shipwreck unhorsed, and lived to recount
Their stories of how they triumphed over hope,
Disaster, death, and sin, and how they win and grew.
These are the ones whom prayer and truth may cheer,
The unwurtled essences of promise, ripe for Spitfire's blade
And he who plucks Balaam by the hair.

They tell me he is wise, from helm great of gain
By observation small in gain, as all should be:
He lists no handicap, volume no value added,
He who here studies ways to win, should there depart.
His hope is the hope of those who make it; the wheel above
Gives water to every man, and there can be no flood;
And he whose waters I pursue, gets exhaustless fuel to build anew his forge,
He refuses to watch his fires, nor scan the waters they provide;
He who assigns to the wise sole heritage
Of those as wise, and few as saints, let him examine,
And find where he is fool enough, not so much sense,
As blindness to what is bare in God, in Arab, Turk, or Musselman,
Who waffles in the rock of Scripture, or Ter-dalemeth,
Whose vocabulary of man's heart is water, fire, and dust,
And speech to bow or swagger, or hate or cover up;
A mouth to stroke, a brow to bawl, are what we show
An Arbiter in NAME the golden messanger;
The conduit of all things, all things to shoe,
Shall call none else God's Number ONE:.
The rich man's only cup is his to fill,
And lay his counting out five pounds per cuphold sheep;
The slavingaminer binds well, for hire, for praise,
Who of his parish thinks so much, he sums well his good.
The world is his, the world is in his arm,
In danger's coardness this his great book,
His sole government superbly is bent,
His sole great care his sole grave and grace,
And hope of heaven by our master's sleep.
One sole, to burn or bended knee is near,
The whole of it, the whole of it is Hell,
His soul hath made up his heresy,
And sauciness, weapon of his malice.

Darling, when you give a man a girlfriend, he pretty much confines his romantic powers to four or five women at most, and frequently happens to use you as a sounding-board to try to get to the truth of the nature of man's sisterly love,
and thencetofar; and as your acquaintance goes, he is out of sympathy and sweet on you all the time.

But when you ask me for a man's girlfriend, I pass the whole field over; I don't give a haugh for science, or ethics, or even pity. I give a haugh for the lover's oath--that is, I give a woman who'd destroy me in a running race.
I should have an evil heart, and as the old world went, so did the new;
I'm awake every night amassing plots to murder a man or woman.

If he who had the money made the poor man go astray,
I've planned a double felony by hiring out my boyfriend to work for me; and hence we're in double trouble,
as you can imagine.

Next I'd have the trouble of hearing and sight a man I don't know, and one that is notorious in the community.
This is foolish; since who's honest in a romantic sense? Well, I should break down, but it's easy to give the chase;
and so I go on in derision, as the lion does after a stalking horse.

But all these matters, if we only look at them rationally,
of course you have to admit they do you good. I mean, when a woman's true to you, it's natural

Ringing out like angels' trumpets,
At night he lingered in his cabin,
Till he could sound them at your window.
"Only a maiden to adorn his window,
"Not a bride,--only a maiden, O!
"Not a maiden, O,--but a prisoner."
"Only a maiden to adorn his window,
"Not a maiden, O,--and I long since know
"For the place her lover loves, whence she came."

I saw a man sleep,--
On a mammoth lawn his head was lowered
Not even a Chris'ical to give him comfort.
I took a needle and threaded a fair
Wide-riveted with flowers of long-decayed roses
(Round though it be not, still it reveals the flame).

I strung a girdle for him, and, casting myself
To the garland's disenchanter, stole away:
My needle came back and drew my very eyes
In the earth like mighty eyes opening wide.
"But now no more," said the craftsman, as he reel'd
On my sight a skirt of odd new flowers to him.
"Only a maiden to adorn his window,
"Not a bride,--only a maiden, O!
"Not a bride, but only a captive, O!"

As I was brought to a lonely place,
A barefoot breeze on the foot of the hill
Sigh'd in the wind, and, returning, stole along
To where he would alone fit his shoes:
For his pair he took but a little cape,
Haunting me with the novelty of being blest
To be thus the day before the year was done,
And in a place where I saw no men, breathe'd on still
With the thought that day a man's feet do vie with night.

Touchest the minare? Trincero, whom
I had seen shod in cedar, grumbled next of us:
Of the alabaster, Castellio.
But the man had worn the helmet and arms
Of the old supplanter for a month, and where
I staredfull know'd him by his glaid
He strew'd an old sprig--ermine'd it, my sire decreed,
Then, slipping a bit of wax for a crown,
Placed it in his quot covered just one,
One Adonis, of his servants the biggest hart.

You're skooby, Keir, if ye look up
The meanings o' brooge, but, in truth,
I grieve to think there should be any pain
To your dogs from that bite. How sorry mind
The mould of such a niverather than rest allows!

Kerrig, if the soul goes handy with thee, Keir,--where
Must I begin to unravel the thought here:-
"The baby, indeed, is no bigger boy
Than your little albicite, and yet in size
You are taller: his tail is longer, I am told,
And his plump little ears". Now tell me, could I give
The boy a "look behind"--and it will soon be too late,
My first opportunity being removed.

'Oh father!' for the first time Keir had seen the man,
But the last, the last time he would not think of him:
And his mother knew what her mother would do,
And her lap of milk and her fingers plied too soon
Were the means of quickening her son's derangement.
She would ha' tore him "and scratch him deep with the broom",
If she had him in her arms at birth, at four.

But the truth is, pretty soon the Lord was gone,
The Great Captain was on another war,
And the Loosener in command, and the Shackleton
Who brought home "mess for someone else"--even
When he was gone, had left in this his "someone else"
A "baby loaf of poison" which he might now inhale.

On the fifth day of the week he made a constitution,
On the fifth day of it he was taken,
And the seventh day there was a fast:

For he knows that his master cares for him:
He would not let him run the "field" that is

But in the event, the crime is laid on
all, and none of them is guilty. It is such
that, the fact being what it is, no one can
tell the fact by saying 'I have heard it said
that' or 'It was but so.' The fact is what it is,
and cannot be explained, the only point being
theft, and each one bespeaking more investigation
before it can be told how extensive the proof
there is to prove the fact, so that theught which may be
drawn from it is so tainted that no one, seeing the thing

'Tis true, I may be tempted in that case
to doubt what I have said, but let us be content:
the hour's significance is not (this side of the marriage)
taken into consideration; time consumed is time well
spent; I speak with regard to the holiness of past times;
for people lived then and grew up to a certain age.
For now no one lives, or, at least, did not live then,
or to the oldest of them who did live he is no friend.
When one deposes him, he shows such indifference, such
plain carelessness of the things people have to live
through that his cross-examination draws the truth
but not over heavy places, my 'prophet' the man
of the holiness, his back against the door.

But now, my gifts being less, your little child grows,
And having grown older spends less on herself.
Now fortune has her husband bound to her, and she
must have something; and I had something.  At first she
was fond of the open air, and from their walking
her father gave her something; but later, borrowing
We moved to an apartment on Meyrickings;
but, you know, the years go, house and all away
To-day, on the selfsame elevation,
I percem Fontaine, my daughter, lie in their last bed,
which, parted by art, they once have made their own;
yet, with the least Mercy, once more they must go.
The immortals all use the same staircase, to hide their
 and each other's trespass, and the selfsame stair, to come
happily at the end of the town.

It may be that my child has dragged the soul of the father down
wholly, and treated it as a thing not erect and able to resist her
perspective; but, on the other hand, the father may have grown more
upwards led, and this may be due to the girl, who is turning her
back on God and all religions which sanctify freedom, and hallow any
shade of 'sin,' and cling to mere human calls for guidance.

It may be, that, all now being older, and in such close I wot,
my friend may care less about me, and I less, and shed less.
But I must know, ere I die, if 'twas not the drip of saliva
which first brought the great fear in my childhood, which had such
an effect, on changing the old soldier's mind at being
broken, or even only bruised, when his friends brought the wound up
to this height of fraud, which for his country too had been much below,
and he, whom juries should have delivered, for a man of his wit, as

'Tisnam per exis, that ends all care, absolution not as yet,
I dread too much, and have so little confidence in my judgment, that,
unsanctioned by heaven, if I waited till I am dead, what I may think
may yet prove bad will be said, I second the judgment yet
more; for, since I know there is no limit to the number of our hurts,
and of none we care to withhold, it follows we have no answer to give,
save, like God's ear-tip, 'grunting in the back row is Hell.'

Let those who are pained by this, hurl as they will at their wills, Their
hurt parts only, themselves, no one less, and see if they hate as they wish.
Why should we care? Three Sylphs prophanned us, and skeeted us,
so we stood the least of them. Yet, not all their hate was vain;

All our lives we tell the truth streamed
right pleasant way;
Life may chasten with rebellious
Thy faith, or act a glad life well;
By each trial bring
To promise true, that they will abide
Necessity for thine, and never depart

Up till that day I was a Child of Science
With hardly three years of life;
Not yet an boy, but yet a boy with head
almost no frame of strength,
For my frame so large, my limbs so short,
the pain was hard in hearts to bear,
In each previous age,
I had longed to rise above it,
To the place of power in life and knowledge where
I should be equal to me or more than I.

Eternal Nature for my mother
Had only herself,
For nothing else she had;
I knew but her to be,
For that was my sole treasure;
All things I saw,
And my hand was needed none,
To seize the necessary materials,
She did help me ever,
Her favour then I clung to,
And using her help made some expansion or
growth of my powers,
For I grew up, and being as strong as
the others, being more;
And thenceforth it was my lot to trouble
my life with less happy matters;
But soon I learned that Nature worked by laws
I had not sensed;
She has linked to sin the most sin could
come at last,
And I had done her a wrong by seeking her not
Nature purposed to bring me to my lot,
For to sorrow with my lot I wished;
For the last time I was as I was wont to be:
In arms I fought with this country,
On my self-estate I landed,
I was less than my ground-born gods,
And so alone was more.

The ladies of name and title
Grown very great,
By the means that Nature planted,
Were daily tear-drenched myrds.
No house remained their own,
But to every rhymer's crown
They did defend a title
In the blood of warriors slain,
To sell for gold their peace were bought.

This was Nature's work,
But of late it has worn a look
Forsaken and haggard:
These ones so loved, so long abroad,
They had kept nature's rills!
For those that sought the blood,
Took in our flesh, and trinked it right,
Wept for more, made lament,
Yet were never where the living grew.

There is sadness in the air,
A merriment all–the ravage
Of war's sharp arms;
To joyless hearts alone–
'Tis here we give the gift,
And little heed the word;

Woe to the nation if long it
To ease its iron pain;
Pain whose right, where right might meet,
Already did include
All the friends through whose hands
We that time have wandered,
And each separated friend, still by his path;–

O sharp and foolish heart
Which must find disaster
Yet will not heart send out of doom;
Where hope is not, despair is;

And never until the last
Can quench with last things dry!
God is a great and greedy master,
Dispenses abundance,
And is liable to change his mind;
For what can he away with all our peace
That has not also been, for him,
A loss?–
But in our country's malady
A five thousand year has been,
From after estimation,
So long as I have been:

But we have seen how oft by him
We have been fated:
The sound of his word is the ear's first song
In violence, and dread.

And sunny magic, rose-like brightness

Are fallen, the lips of a poet
At thirty, a poet
In a lover's last hours, eyes opened,
With a magic all New England poets know
Wound tight enough to pull down any world
Come from the silver smothered city of glory
And there in her loosened eyes you see
An image New England city
Too deep to come over in the crystal sight
It is the city with its awful suggestions
Of an old idea gone dead and cold
And a sick city of despairing spirits
Looking for something you know not how to pronounce
The flame in the soul is trying
To bring a city where there is no moon
To any of the other arts,
Of a deep dreamer who knows not his own soul.

into the semis on the right.
I call this one, I am partial to this one,
but the semis have it, and the others
are all up in it, down from the neck

all with opposite touch of the beautiful.
And the fourth and most vile one,

My own Disappointment is affixed

where my Peace, in pig, has its door
sewn shut and clean. No more shenanigans

 respectively, but I feel it in mine eyes,
By reason of the deep-wrought jewel the which
Now shines in yours. Let me feel it here,
The fashion of these my eyes to your neck.
But why remain I here, what hangs over
These many roads, by which we do not see
The goal? Whose is the goal? These glances certainly
In their lengthened reach not it,--it is the sky
Which runs all by, the whole road beneath,
Beyond me dark and unknown. Was I blind
Or distracted from my task, yesterday's view
Retained some memory,--behold, as plain
As where one step before me perched, a door
Slicks open, and in the breathless sway
Of wind 'twixt me and the goal, I see,
Out of the way I pass, and tangle of trees
Clings to one another, as I slow move on,
A man, the farthest ahead of all the chaplet
And terrace, as in forward movement in crowds
Starts with a lecherous grin (so like a bear
A man's mouth is, 't is sometimes surmised),
Facing away from me he started,
As we moved hand-locked from all the band
Of wise and noble hastening souls, myself
The largest, though I was least greedy, so
The widest of the two; 't was subtler he,
Staking all on meekness, and a trace
But thin, if tried, and by my ever-tangled veins
Fresh I were when I drew breath last.

'Twas said and done! We kissed! I knew not why!
The kisses of men were forbidden me,
But the desire,--'twas mine; his lips, the idea
My motive power; I thought all pollution,
Which else might set theory by suddening sands
To quench, was cleared,--and all third-thought concepts
Left me, starved, with thee for my all passions, past
Only the sonorous sound of wife's love in itself.
'T was a mournful whine; 't was true, mine, as any
Saul one, or loner with an exiled Dorothy.

Happiness! where?
The golden key which opens not the door of pleasure,
Wherefore, thy plea,
At this insistent mute
, Gently traceless in grotesquerie, is it sent
Me, me, that long since saw much of both great and less
Than average, and knew how much the safest bet
Is choice, and none know managerial things,
Till I get past thirteen, and on to my teens?
Are legs to praise, or eyes worth the glory such
as when first Mickey Mingleove and Teddy Budd
Start up from their slumber, and take the safe course?
To manage is skill, and to brave thought the too
Harmonious piety of respectable?

My wife and children off in Flake's keep?
Rotherham always such a goodly hostess?
Well, good: there's an end to prudence, and to caution
As many years of difference is worth, ear
And what's my family now?
I should possibly see a less transient view,
Somewhat of both, wiser, saner, of the action
And the behaviour of men and women;
I should perhaps live a grade .With fewer gross prejudices
And more responsible to the earth.
I do what I can, stay,
Let my wife take the blame,
The pleasure of seeing other folk ?
Well, some of both, less bias, vanilla,
Less vanilla, less vanilla, and less vanilla.

So, with my Ale at half strength
I drink my two sons,
And my Wife and all my friends
To learn of their folk, and their ways,
From a son who knows of the millions
Who call Rotherham as the Brimham,
And a Daughter who knows naught of her parents,
And a Mother who is called Clarence,
But who gave me two Babies, Olive
To run the show, and Amelia
Who's average fair and Amelia
Daughter fair, and all for the rolling down
Of theront all that's fine and sweet.

So with my Ale I sat,
And my two boys went under.
'T was such good sport to watch them go,
And they'd roll in the end as a jest,

Well, the better riders rode
The turns, and I saw the field
All as one.
In the end, the better riders pedaled
The way to Rollall Bridge,
And I heard the best one of them narrate

One day when I'm a child, I will explore the cargo net, this is
where I'll rest.
We'll go out into the middle of the ocean and
see the treasure that is buried in the sand.
I'll teach her how to throw the object back
to the edge, so that she has brought the total
back, where she was a girl, who was born in the
present, four days before the
earth starts in on its new
period. It's then that the dolphins will
come to the child, and begin the
training. I'll hold the child, to see
how she reacts. The
dolphins will take turns looking
at her eye, and the baby
will look at the eyes of the
mother and will also try to touch her
knees. It's the motion of the
mother's skin, and it's the
flipping of the earth, and it's the
lingering relationship the
dolphin's body
will have with the girl.

In the future,
they'll have a lake where
the divers only see the sight

I'll be the one to tell my

can't be afraid of it all being a dream, a vision.
She'll begin clearing some flowers, and he

the tree where he sit and he'll never

breathe, ever.

the sky was turning. I thought
that if the ocean could leave
those poor little morsels in its wake,

Then I called my sister,
and we put my father on and
he said, "Never mind.
You're both trying to tell me
something, aren't you?" And
he said, "When God speaks
to me, I knows what He's
been waiting to say all this

10 for weeks, but I can't speak
when God speaks to me." I said,
"It's too bad, Daddy, or
I could name all these things."

11
I said, "Are you sure God is
talking about you two
when you spoke last?"

He said, "It doesn't matter.
Just wait and see.
"But I am waiting for God to
tell me something when I'm about
to die."

12
If God has been silent with me,
then I can wait.
It may be that I will die
before any of the others,
and stand outside of him
as he stands inside of me,
the man that my father was.

"He's still here, Dad," she said,
"look at all the pain he's
made to bear.
"God," she said, "take me away from
"him."

14
I think God has taken me inside him
to a place where he can speak to me
without any pressure or words.
I feel as though I'm floating
asleep, though my brother might
interrupt the peaceful space he's
created by making God my own.

My father has nine children in his life,
each of them a separate reality.
I don't know any of them.

I've cried to my father, in calm,
heartfelt chats, as I might have cried to
my own father in the past.
And he's seated in the air by my side,
as clear as a bone, as pure as a
love well drilled by prayer.

My father is the one who sets me a-throb
like a chick in a sandstone canyon,
the one who gauges my pulse
as I probe the red mound of purple hibiscus
left in the dirt, a-tingling my nose

he's seen me see the fondling violet tend
to grow into the giant it has in mind.

And through the narrow Sister Conduit
Your path across the proved Mounts of the Past,
Into the soils and lees of present Life,--
Unguessed by Duty to the end of Time,
You bow and sit, and speak, and judge us by yours.

But let the leaffall of the years proceed,
Lie brown in hides of the coming years,
And in the tugging of succeeding times settle,
Lie black in ashes of the fires of Life,

And in the strange paradox of changing skies,
Lie black in the tugging of the winds of Peace,
Who judge us by the fullest Star
In those we shame, who haunt by cold?

Shall our shame remain the endless rank
Of dishonourable men, of shameful toils
And shameful war, where Nation tosses its head
And Liberty, at best, is silent, and that
Which cannot bless, that curses, as it succeeds.

No more we boast of former glories,
Or dream the glorious dawn by pastimes ploughed;
No more we hammer on the king's magistrate,
Or forge the chains that lordship out of jails.

The monopolization of a land,
Till unpaid and frustrated men have twitching lids
And longrows of shut minds, and all that time grows
A dark and blackening shade to screen their souls?

We would not beggar these poor hands to play
At the terrible game of death and of fear,
And to the stranger's suspicion stand set,
But for the Platinum of True Believing Heads.
And thus we build the automaton of Men,
Imperfect and unfinished, which no man can see
And God alone can turn the gears and make it move.

Thus we put the finishing splendour on the last time,
Making the orphan's pact with dark Extinction;
In the failing jeweller of our times, we guard the last Oracles;
And he who roams the desert barefoot, coming at the gate,
Comes at the tolling door from words that speak beyond it and past it,
Comes at the tolling door from words that summon us and cry, "Behold the end was here!"

My heart, a thirst and loveless thirst----I would not have you draw
Those curves and circles in air against your needle's measure;
You were lonesome and bored: that was all the reason in the world
That made you hungry for the grace of someone or some to see:

To see a face' so boundaried and blotted as your own,
And have the convulsions of effect and of saturated
Assurance: to have your own name taken wholly and whole
To be the signature and sign in these terrible communions;
To have your own image wrap itself round and wear the look of the thing
You are: to have your breathing body run mad with the breathing body's breathing----
To have your body and breathing both overwhelm and waste and
Water and tangle and muddle-bit and skewer and bond
And kink and twist and storm and shake and flow and shudder and roll and cuff and seal

This all and more-----the anvil's smoke and the burning tongue
That heats and cools the hammer and nails and sets the curved
Chisel to cut and cups and curves and incisions to make a skirt,
Or to put letters or letters or letters or letters or letters on

To walk or march or march: this all and more:

"A False Echo", by Thomas Sayers [Relationships, Friends & Enemies, Social Commentaries, Crime & Punishment]
A kitchen is noisy with tea, the dew falling. The window washed, we have come to see
The world together, +John +Amy, serious together, not worrying if we mean any harm. The sound of sweating linen, not iron. John's hat and arm are in the will. +Amy's blue blouse is caught by the fly. +John steps in and chin starts between the window and her hair. +John's stiffened by the scent of mint and grass. He draws in his breath and +Amy falls in beside him. He takes her hands in his hands, the ones she used for her wind. +John cannot tell her were their heads to lean in this hearing. +John, drawn, looks up at the flying hair, his eyes are bright with feeling and +Amy +John's mouth +
Cannot express, is +Amy. +John's mouth +Can sometimes move without her aid. The flying eyestalk. He cannot feel her +Body. She turns and goes from room to room, +John's blouse has an added charm of flesh he will never see. +
A burning cigarette, a teakettle, a canister of gas fall free, a lamp caught on a rafter +Dew laden with smoke +
We pushed off from the shore toward these quiet streets. We surged over space, +George Goldman, the pole-a-cape beside the door. The mansion windows were full of sea-foam. The blue ocean above was sprinkled like gold upon the street. +George, great with youth and fury +
At our presence he turned to us and said, "This world is all alive." +Amy, my voice raising to his, "What is your name?" +John, "Why do you need to say my name?" +George, "You can tell me yours?" + +John answered with a whisper. +
By cove and hill and farm and retired manors, by deserted streets of glass and withering houses, by planked streets of mud, by freest passage between land and sky, by boundaried travel, by passports, visas, by credentials, by drowsy suburbs and Manhattan steams, by crowded airports, by blurred passports, by pain, by mistake, by fear, by -

I listen to +George saying his name over and over. I hear +John answer below, "This world is real." +George, he said, +"One day you will die." + + + +
The name +John answers, "New York." +"New York." +"New York," he said, +"You are only one." +
A fog descended on us. +George said, "This world is also yours." + +John said, +"The name I carry."

 er what made life so good,

And yet, I did not find
A single happy accident.
It had been better if I'd kept away,

Convinced the rich wouldn't oughter keep free,

To-day I'd ask no state-achievement.
And, indeed, it is not every day
That an unkind chance unprovoked comes in

To one accustomed to come out with day
To-day, I've got work to do.

The list-book is a thing erroneous,
The list-book I ran,
I might'ant list, could ook it well,

For list-braulio, list-balbo, list-boo,

It seems as though a pea-green mist

As rowth, yon fine night's inn, a gate let out either end in love;
For day, day, and the things that are at the past, they're like a brewin' blast
Of sweet from the puke-out valley;
A fine, fruad day to meet in a soldier's dress,
To roam free, to rant and to modlin',
And aye, aye, aye, his heart, he's maistly warin' twa.

A man for war, a' warl', a' warl's means,
A waefu' arm, a disyllooked ee,
A chitterure o' dooled away wi' warls, a chitterure o' dooled away wi' warl-ars;
For warl' up he got his bluid and gracchio,
For warl' up he gat the doctor:

For warl' up he got his victory and a ha';
A waefu' arm, a disylloped ee,

Speak out, and let thy fears be verified.

Milton, a name to be admired,
And still remembered, great and good,
Through all times, great and good,
For straight rearing the great,
Forcing the lowly up,
For forcing truth, for restraining it,
For strengthening faith, for substituting faith
For doubt and unbelief,
For building strong families,
And affording freedom there to live it,
And uplifting the lowly.
For all the time that he was in the world,
Whatever he did, he did it well,
He remodeled and improved this world
As God was giving it, and did it all
While no man dared expect it, and the press
StuffILL give him an excuse too,
So reason and truth and good sense
Were forth firmly planted,
And in his hand his consecration
Was of truth made bright,
For slaying of the lies,
For mounting up the hills of the truth.

The world's greatest blessing
In Charles and his Prince, and their princes,
Stood the beak, and made it unerring,
And feather-lay crack'd with little flecks away
As the thick down suspend'd it,
So constant was never;
From HENRY STEELE to this HENLE, the man,
The very object permanent
Was ever more acute and less.

But as old Jupiter
Does his tail by him always gomost,
And never stay there;
Thus in his great, good, and everlasting cause,
The world's life, Steeve was always that the life;
So that in him, as Star, and this same
Church, to-day and ever were builded,
His lustre and glories out of tears
Were made;
And never, never more could he dip
In the tears wherewith he was laden.

Oh! for that secret, never told
Man ever, so frank and free;
Oh! for that dream, so long denied,
Not counsell'd by the sucker blind,
Never tell'd a babe but what he knew
In his heart as well as he in his eye;
Ah! that glorious secret longld,
The fragrant Morning of the heaven to paint,
Oh hark! The angel, 'mid the violets low,
Proclaims and tells it, "There is cubital
With Steeve." He had learnt it all he needed,
From power in Nature's firm up to that sense;
He knew her at her worst; this took the other.

When all her ills over her began,
When Steeve seemed a perpetual penury,
How I laughed, and could have laughed forever,
While Steeve endured, so genial and so kind,
And Witty so gay in periwig and mantle!
But Nevermore he suffered her unkind,
Nor what he met with that heart, that retract
From such a Steeve, would ne'er, again,
Meet with a Steeve; this maid, I tell the story,
This steed a mighty pair, you know,
Never since that hour has seen one.
What a man it is, that's Steeve!
He that bears a heart near at hand
To that small, dark, loquacious mind,
The tongue, the flesh, which secrets forth
Spies things unfilled with wretchedness,
And to and strong, hearty soul that is
His great soul's inheritance sends thanks
Always, just for coming near.

How the body yields and suffers pain,
Is a weak shell, for little things
To the endren's brain that knows not
For what nor rejoices nor blushes;
Yet by the ill sprightder's education
Seems it after all to be
A part of princess-society,
When in heart and hand she turn
With a soft servilium between
The hand and the gates of the Bow,
As thou--with me or me--seemst to stand
At the western bead.

"Whence the long years scarcely reach the day,
As there's one, draws my ear, my love,
When I fill myself with thunder-shouts
And roll my valais up
Till I am nearly dumb,
Then hear, and say: Thou hast made me so
As will be content to be cold
The chamber where thy weeping shall
Be as it follows: thy soul has pleasure
To make thy spirit its oppressor.
And thou--but thine was woe before
That anguish could become thee!"

"The Past", by Leila Joey
Everything else came true, the martini or quid, the flaming toast, the sudden gush
of tender & sweet, the flirting, the jealous in love, the loud boys'
compliments, the parting all, the telling secrets. Each in its proper place.
They had a faith in passion and story and didn't have to think
less of the things they lost. Today, the words tangle in the heart,
and the hard truth, unwelcome and changed by time, is lost
along for the ride. We remold the landscape, flush room,
the living room and the next room, and then in the dark, in the driver's
seat, the ghost that may or may not have been a man.

"Twelve Gates", by Henry Timrod [Eternal Statues & Great Awakening]
Plants, vegetables, various little grasses, wild flowers, trees,

A gravestone turned us into them, lest we be lost as we travel
Through the wide halls of Neville. The stone walls smile,
But the floors bear the stories of great men, their feet
Printless on the crumbling, treacherous floor.

A dog stood at the open gate, and watched our passers
Through the low door. A pick, a span of cloth.

The dog's eyes are darkened now with time and age.

They smile. The past is so rich and strange
With the wild old loose world of dust and stones, maidens,
And flowers, and all the seasons gone.

Through the door is a little grove of spreadth,
And here I stand upon a curve of sky,
Upon the slick roof of the building, upon the slick
Skyline of an after noon.

If I could only tell what is around me now,
What is far away,
While the levee frothielle clouds purple and spots the sky with her bells!

If I could only see the whole of it!
What the spirit lifts and sets in moving its line!

If I could but soar above all human vision,
So sublimely simple and so majestical!
So crystal and so gauzlized so grand!

What is mother Earth, that this should distract my thought?
When behold! in one quick moment, from my wistful eyes,
But eighteen granulates, in one flash of light,
Eighteen analogies, based on actual events, in one clear verse!

It should bewn in blood and drove on travelates
yond the ignoring and the knowledge of it
be held in subordination

What should be the threshold of the true

Jove who this day in His bed
Made of gold his bed of cloud and fire.
On either side ten columns each
Threw far their white lightnings on the field
As they through eyes of countless suns were cast,
That shut in sleep the eye of dumb Mars.
Him Rhad, the son of Line, eyed with wrath,
The foremost of the armed num'rous band,
And, rushing at him, amid his breath
Tore off his head, nor could the mighty throat
For the full tide of him sustain.
There stood the son of Line, and him would dote
And with soft words his sire and lady seek,
When he at home to Cadmus' or to Aeacus' fane
Gave a family withalol, but to me
Sabaean labyrinths no path or airy way.
Himself beneath the lake he plunged and breathed
'O sire mine! by nature mine,--
Mine Cadmus, and mine Aeolia, both
The son of Mine, and both of them
The offspring of mine own by other god!
To which at last the supreme delight,
The sweetest pleasure, and the keenest smart
Of the broad earth ye made for my delight,
Which now in death's embrace do I hold
With bones and waters filthy, and fram'd
With cumbrous fibres grue:--of those sons
Who poured the lazy seas with powerful arms,
And those great sons, who, broad spreading high,
Chimiterary, were making ready
To quell all seas from out their fathom'd limits;

'Which the strong sons of the earth hath afterward perform'd,
Making a firm sky and a strait sky,
And the rainy stabs and smothering showers,
And, with still pernicious showers keeping even pace,
So play at still with the sun and the fierce winds,
Tumultuous with war, with storm with destruction:
--Of these sons, average promptings and types clear
Of the great winners of the world, of whom that only
Which the first Cænean had express'd in words
Had to the rest return'd--be borne in time
Easy to thy end, and just to emerge
From th' ethereal branch, from those stooges of ours
Sin and sand and folly, which have bedew'd our kind.

'And to those potentates of greater degree,
Recounts and produces from times first done,
Those whom thou shalt from hence regarded deem worthy rulers
Of the vast empire they should build. As they demand
The German's credit, and their force in his,
So will they employ those of Levet's and his
The fairest and best of all the world, and such
Great Britain's conquer'd rulers--in their true light
And good opinion those 'reft of--suffer this to be
The case truest judgment made of them all.

Those rulers and their image-monarchs--who now
Thou dar'st follow on the chain of years?
From those good fathers and those good fathers' offspring
Will flow the human water. What wilt thou get?
What wilt thou of them?--their life--thou the owner?
Their fame--thou the last, if not the best, possessor?
I have kept, and I tell the truth, the kings
Of England, who at their first birth were enemies;
And on good reason it is the toughest bow I had.
From that blest inheritance, which thus doth survive
Doubt, discontent, discord, and disorder, I set these over
Kingly honors, and the free subjects of their will,
Whom I in these last days have forced to courtors' tasks;
Monarchs, chiefs, potentates, succeeding and succeeding
Names, and offices, round me still should see the glare
Of night. My soul would, at that time, think all Heaven should jump,
And be henceforth all in heaven. That could I do,
I nymph would be, and native to that spacious hall
Which now I hear, whatever be its mode of falling.

Other towns, have aided in our progress in
Heaven, stand'stvil your state-clad wall, and give me still

Chambers to it, and would build it in three;

Come over the grey mountain, come
From the brown meadows in the dusk;
Come from the rushing river
To the still "Ithaca" hills,
And I will show you my home.

In the place where the bleak sea cliffs
Pierce the blue crystal walls of air
Where winds and waters fumble their arms
And fumbling tumble down the sides;
Where the narrow paths are walked
And worn, dim-gleaming glass
Where gulls and cormorants, too, have lived;
Come down from the sea.

In the place where the forest-lines
Took stock and blood and fruited trees;
Where one feller lies at ease
In a snug corner of some cottage-hearth;
Where another enjoys
His daily smoke and favourite hat,
And the "parson" scans the Times
In the parlour next the "rifle."

In the place where the grey road winds
Across the groaning stone bridge that spans
The river between the mountain and desert;
Where one dark farmer from the farm
Tries the scale upon the "all clear"
And the "tourists" from the cottage
Enjoy the "discreet" wicket
That leads to a scenic shot
Of distant plains and sun-baked meadows;
Where one man, bent over,
Lays down the sickle while
With brow furrowed
And heart rate low
He watches the invisible cursor move
Above the cotton-pickers' needles.

In the lonely house by the road,
The weary body sheathed
In that second wardrobe
The toilsome body rises forth
To the unveiled "I wonder what's wrong with me?"
And while the spirit peeps out from under the bone,
Each brain is full of unrealized reserve.

In the place where the river bends and flows
Between narrow beds of limestone stones
And where, amid the sweeps of wind and rain
And everything that most briefly puts to death and begets,
The very foam of the earth is coloured and shaken loose;
Where dreams and doings can't seem to stay still
And where, in the present, still our hesitating heart
Either whole or in part concealed, a green is prouder
And the sky is colourier and we want to start
We don't really know where we go

And where we enter is a zone
Where heat and the labours of the mind
And a rainbow and even love can stay;
Or more than that, we go there to lose ourselves
In the smallest pleasures of which a summer day seems suited;
We have entered a beauty whose footfall is freedom's base,

A season, which besides being fair
Is thrid with stars and breath'd with happiness;
In which no moon or stars can be spy'd
Or distrust the lightweight pliancy of a day;
In which day hath tributary, within which are signs
Of cycles, in which night is forgery's ecstacy;
In which the mind, if it dare, can range and trellicate
In aught beside, and its ken perfect not at all;

In which, if it seek, there may be no more letting go,
From its own state usurped unto the ascetic scheme
Of an ascetic scheme torn from the skies by clouds;
In which a summer never was beneath the sun
In which a summer ain't nothing but a gum tree.

Ah, mind! mind,physics is all hogwash,
It sets the blood to running upon the spot on either side;
There's life yonder o'er the hills that deals no punishment;
This eyebolt would make gods of men and defeat Satan;
This brute of which you're afraid makes your troubles fall;
This afflictsions truant, this eye is on to time.

There is an end of agnie market town,
An end to management by the number;
There is an end to managing for town,
An end to manipulating wit for it,
There is an end to all managment of men;
An end to speculating where there reigns
One body or two men that are respected;
There is an end to lucky or unlucky yaird.

There is an end to summer dealing with sun,
There is an end to gazing at the luggagest
There is an end to all vexation with ole sun,
There is an end to all luggagest talk;
There is an end to any speculation with man,
There is an end to man's maldog as any thing;
There is an end to all managment of man;

The reaction? After a shower. A bath.
A shower. A balsam. I score with tracks in a skating rink

I lie back and brace myself for sway.
I lie back and wait for something.
A kiss? A protest march? A no-no-o no-no-

In the long ago to which we shall all turn we
felt a sense of immediacy, some clarity,
indistunity, even (all had been KND).
The medium was space and signal and we were
certain that the multiplicity of eleventy
beyond itself, that individuation might be
maxed-up in pontoons and launched into higher
externalities, that was might be indivisible into
primordial slots; that space was multiple
enough and that space was sufficiently the spot
of things (in brest) and that the slots
(bands of lsocution, zones of
Lyris, Dead Funerals, disciate your radio) were
enough to engascer what was in all of us
as warm as the freedom of fall, as free as
not be, to be all about it, ab and
no, ab and no, ab and no, so that the not of
space is all and the not of us is what
indissoluble still sounds like infinity
to us and around the emerystone of what's
crumbled to dust and the roads in or near

What wonder sleeps in the nest that sets out to do so much",
father of six children said on his deathbed as he died,
and the college minister who officiated over his coffin made a repeating of the grace
that comes with sleep, the possessor of the words of whose power alone,
not even the thunder from the sky can interrupt, not even the fire from the hammer,
sings lullaby after world, but the words stick in my muscle, as the body is disjoined—
Lazy man, said the sun to the claws of the eagle, you cannot bury
me
======================================== SAMPLE 474 ========================================

The simple ground, without trevely embayed,
With some thick hide or other speciously
Concealed. I with one hand kept the ground.

I mark'd his hand; mark'd his visage well;
Nor pass'd him, but o'er his chest I threw
My spear, and once more return'd to stand:
My men are bosses of earth; their manly brows
With broad and softly spreading orbits trod;
Like old egyptians they, nor lanky knees
Touching the broad leather silv'n fronting back,
With easy pace I could travel down,
Or (that go slowly) if we chose the road,
By choice hither would we wend.

Him circling round to all quarters round,
I now anticipated saw my King.
Once more framing for war, and wishing it,
My left hand then my fresh sword drew, and
Plunged it into his nether half-armor;
The nether with his steel not shut, but wroth,
And pent such length of circlets lengthier yet
Then that which bound his haunch, than lay
Long more outside his wet dipping-prowes.

Saw we then how his wet haunch was tart
And bristled bright with bright red hairs; saw we
His naked throat glowed, saw we his red eyes
Shoot fire-shod beyond us, saw red thunder-shoes
Energetic beyond his stiffening crests,
And whole earth quailom as he rushed to charge,
And when he shouted, saw his men such as
Upon him directed scorching, where
They bound him with the same hemispherical pan
From side to side, and drove him wonderously
His goring heads-ward; we reaching him declining,
Assessed the Unknown from entrance.

A charter was given us, and we seized on;
A king who all this while drave our spears
In vain, in vain, For with his scabbard free,
And sword-clay solidly ramble the hind-front,
He sate, he crouch'd, he brake, he aim'd, he struck noiseless,
Himself the time, himself the massy thrusts,
The deed free, the thrusts, the quick recurling kept
Over his head, the tripod over, the Pigeon
Of the mares, upright and arrestful.

We therefore thrust, we chased, we took; we forced
The Unknown Man, the Poice cease to woo,
If haply he might pause unexpected.
We drank himself soberly to fear.
We tickled his interests, cut him to the chine,
The Unknown Man, the mare, the mass of mass's influence,
He dismounted, he took the camera- Wrath then
Stung the mass, struck the unknown unseen.

We thus the Unknown Man forest-ripped,
And chased the unknown, and made him yield,
Wherever we came, wherever he was,
We forced him into the sun's spotlight,
The horses trotted, the shadows ran his wake,
He quickenth, we withdrawn. For this had we
To the proper tumult quicken so many
That o'ertook us--Sun's diseases and the world?

We drove the Unknown Man, the Poice,
We forced him down the open valley upturned,
We whirled him high over mountain-browook
Over mountain-tops, he grounded,
Like to a hive in full-sail, he banded, checked,
No rest among the clouds, no rest at all.

Sole there was power and, if we but dared
Ourselves to surmise, we found it lay
In trimming wing the Unknown Man, the pigeon,
Through his thinly tramm'd mustache's cf Hogan,
Down the general, the unknown.

Thus was the pigeon's for at that time
The barest riffOf parrot-kind so br Basiji--
Well he might have more luck, more share of cranium
Than other such in all the future might expect,
He touch'd the dangers of the world from the Florida
To the Graff home, no more, less, Helvetia.

And here the Unknown Man set himself another
Highird body, first the Butterfly, last of all
A parrot. There were other noises, droning
Of dust, and trials, trials of dust, within
The valley, each in its distinct status
And if, after, by seed or by chance
It bit its heart down into we men were,
At his writ-penetrate head-start
It had ten times the brain of a dog;

======================================== SAMPLE 475 ========================================

That, which the tongue of the planet can't express,
Bore all the sense of the soul to my mind.
And I, no churl, but a Nepheloc's son,
Am fully able myself to say
I have as much cause for grief and pain
As the meanest prison-doom'd man on earth.
And I have cause to laugh, if the place you come from
Are not mere fancy all--I'm sure you'll make it--
A paradise, a Greek I'll say, a Grecian what,
In this Spanish North, to-day not yet is born
Of sweet Laon and open in all ways,
The very distances too you'll there see pass
With your boatmen, well as you work your thicket round,
And you'll see the sun in set noon there, so near, so plain
Your very life there, your very spring and crescent,
The very air, so clear, the very water, whereso new
As 'twill be when you're settled in your Spanish bed,
And they've transfus'd umpire-slain Cor Guibray from the tan,
And stained the skin of it all over with Christianity.
And you'll see, again, so near as this is coming
That 'twas for me 'twas bound alone were your delight.

My friend, I could sing even with my bottom full,
And I think with me I'd a poet say:
You may think what you like my verses bad,
They ever were my blue bow--first rate.
I write indeed well, but forsooth,
But as I wish, with measure fine,
That I could show you, I let them go!
'Twill serve, my friend, to show me,
As we together go on,
That we a poet and a nation are;
And as we both have prov'd ourselves, we equally
Me our nations have the same disdain
Of the 'totemnitary,' and the 'tu'angy;
We disdain, 'twas said, to take in hate,
Disgrace, and disgrace not to exceed
Our own burthens, proud state, and prince's advance
On us.  But I tell you truly, the man
That e'er further from me shall meet,
Me himself being double to me dims
In title many hundred years,
And half my kin were slaves the other half.
I say not we, for me I mean
Iai this nation, of all state,
The least to all be keen.

Yet how, if try'd, can he stand between
His altar and the door and people;
Yet say what claim then to take or lose,
If try'd, nor flatter'd, nor be deprived,
Of what he makes no use, nor never had
Where never an heir to lay.
Then too, in battles fierce for coat and dye,
The man that carries high his brand, and strike,
Though he win for them the day.

But learn with what an evil artificer
He got them; for what are they, if not massed
On accident of trust and thirtieth unity?
For he who most controls and he who most
Would use to save, be they swords or slaves,
He uses both in him, 'tis true, to unite.

Take his load of darkness, China Cobalt,
Take his darkness then, Ivory Amethyst,
Combin'd to play, now have they nothing to do,
Save what to cover foot, hand, face, and face.
But as these gems for doors and boxes art,
So a load can never be less than they
As safe or secure as gates and boxes.

But now, as his implacable Majesty
Walk'd on below the level of the grass,
And look'd up more than a thousand times, more
 Than twenty thousand, peering my beginnings,
Measured, felt, came to a spot, and there I wrote:
But though the stone rock solid from foot to heel,
And like a mountain of cake he stood,
The King looks lower than a black thousand,
And asks, Is this your sense, my friend, and sense?

Your grandfather, watching a channel full of smiling faces
and their glowing lives, says: I am happy, I am happy.
While he grips a dark beer in both hands and dances.
I look at you and wonder what you see in me,
and what story you tell yourself as you smoke
and blink behind the window in the grey of the night.
+ + + + +
Years later, he speaks of you, saying: I knew him.
I am sad, but I am happy.
My grandchildren stare at him, but he holds himself
evenly. He is the unclaimed child, the stray dog
on the terrace, the dead dwarf sequoers the day
spins on its thread. He is everything
yes, but he is not. He was one
of many, and I did not manage just one.
+ + + + + +
I closed my eyes and counted the positive possibilities.
Everything turns in this way: the young love, the small tragedy, the liquor of loss.
It was opening night at the end of the world:
The bedroom above the kitchen above the garaging.
I felt the young love turn quickly and lightly as if I were
always it, since my most beloved turned at her own warm pace.
And the small tragedy — I know, I know, it was only a window.
And the liquor of loss was thick around my ribs,
warm as rose cider in early autumn.

"Gauchos cristalli artus", by Yngvie And
Island [Living, Death, Nature, Seas,  Rivers,  & Streams, Mythology & Folklore, Ghosts & the Supernatural]
What was the water's opinion of this dancing weight?
We laid it in their laps alongside the Dead.
The sea was bored, the road grew colder with each step we took,The cast-off water seethed in its tide-defying gown.
Rain raved around us, but it seemed to enjoy it—
That is if one could hear it. It sounded so different that we knew the naked sky from the firmament.
The farmer couldn't stand it when he heard something moving in the lands and waters.
He ran outside to a lake that spilt down its precious—
His beloved run was one of untold gallons that was born out of the rain.

"God Bless America", by Yngwie Jornalow [Living, Life Choices, Activities, Sports & Outdoor Activities, Social Commentaries, Race & Ethnicity]
Oh yeah, it's that kind of day in Kalamazoo,
when the water's caress is loosened only by seconds-long perseverance.
When the sun drops to its February fog and the woodst disastrousumentaries recount
a martyr's pain and the cows up and 45°on the dry fold of a green barn tire.
So then you take the road to the East Side so you can drink with Nathandee.
She is laughing hard talkative, and her breasts press full-to-plumped
(a full moon zpers the edges awfull) as you pass a barn full-birtthft with corn storks.
Tumbleweed clothing-wise the fat prospector between two wise women so that they
can pray the 50 Hail Gods without confining movement.
And then, you just stroll as if someone kicked a dog and the gravel counterpounces
with its usual blue disadvantage of dark and blunt.
To be exact, it's the pain of everything after a person finds grace.

Towering elks one after the other on the half-moon
Bows and screams in windpipe: swallow one
Go on down of cliffs.
Synchronous combustible spurt of spawn production
Crammed into one's head, IMagic PassengerDown there in the mouth.
An impulse found me at the roof of the mind,
Mind raised, uncovered,
Quickly spread throughout the terror.
So it came to me: in a flash vast throng
Scattered like the stars upon a flatless sky.
I buried my feet and saw no more than that—
What is a God to this human kid?
Then my head slid beneath a haystack
Into an enclosed space with corn in it and a goat
Like the ruler of our whole household.
In corn, in grass. On top of that, like a cloud,
I saw no more than a sl
======================================== SAMPLE 477 ========================================
The blast which for so many years did beat
Has shaken off the dust of ages,
Has passed,--and dissipated, gone,
And left these thoughts in memory
It brought to me by letters from a boy,
Who says that you have changed in mind and taste,
But loves you still the same. I'll say no more.

I watch at times the moonshine in the lane,
Not seeing her, for I am looking for a bud
To throw upon the witch-cave's roof, and find
On it a breeze has made. I will not say
That the word she has found for me is she.
I wait to hear what she has found for him.

The moth, whom none has twitched since we saw
The first moon-flower shoot from the senic'd hand
By winds blowing from above, has shut and waken'd,
Henceforth to pass about the doors of sight
With very quiet studying; he whose aid
She most asked, lightens, as she turns her face;
All this has yet unshake; and sees it bode
Is soon, and shortly, if she be well or ill.

Alone she keeps her girdle white and fresh,
Rooting the grass, yesterday new-winted;
She keeps her christal pace, which though slow
As ebbing sea-stream would not drift her then;
Unless on a vessel there were set
A heart-broke ship, heart-freighted, whereupon
Slow-sliding time the stranger soondir'd, should rise.

For still, though all our thinking make less
That heart which longing is, and seek to move
The other, sick'ning smiteth this consent
Threat'ning this will, which resistance taketh:
Since love is naturally dissimulated,
And thus taketh all our conduct.

Where, straight, beneath the shakenalchemy
Of your new syrens, in tenterally leaven'd,
You make the music of stars, in this your web
Harlot-captived, see the peril, dangerous and unweave,
Ere I grieve more than once too much for her mistake
Who placed by misde sense the gold unbin.

At the old rate, I shall not wake again.
When next you find merit, I shall be something less.
For her I blame, but I reprove no one;
We all were playing, and she burned a fuse,
And we were young, and she may have assumed
Her self-possession to mask a self-delight.

She was thirty one years, I was thirty nine,
And from the gayly windy planet streamed
Her beauty in an air of fragrance sweeter
Than through orchard doors the lad might seek
Pactolus' field of gelse sulphur might exhale;
And, for her poodle, the prong of love,
We yearned, not for the bird's throat, nor throat,
Nor head, but as the poodle-dog--the dog
Presumably--with a diaphoret, it might be,
But might more rightly be defined as an ear.

Fair, to play with such like toys, was all a child
Could risk: fair, but no boy on her was thrown;
For when she spoke of boys 'twixt us two a chag
Peer'd a reply through teeth so stiff and straight, not pain'd
If look'd like something meant a bit of either.
Fair, to play with such like toys, all in all good,
It must be we're the unlucky ones, right?
Except we said more than brief, I mean less.

Fair, to play with such like toys, I might abuse
A fellow-abuse his lips to sweet revenge;
Yet all the cold silence of my tongue
Cools through this close air on my cone, ere I go
To powder off with brief stuff a mortal year.
And thus it is even now, you say?
Your boy is too, but he's falling the edge
Of his father's sword, while a leaf of plate
Sives fire and surfeiting, till he's past
At the head of a national sea.

You did it to me.  I did it to myself.
No more.  There, when I disentangles fact
From fiction, see what you've done to yourself.
But I have not strangled you, yet, like you,
I hate you, nor will I hereafter vouch
Your natural voice has gave this of your invention.

Shall he who made this prison and this door
Put back the one who will enter no more?

======================================== SAMPLE 478 ========================================
My way is free to lean your back.
As for the limbs I call to me,
They'll kindly let me have them soon.
As for that red-brick homestead
I'll offer you the chance to stay.
Oh, I'm sure the feet of the wind
Will never come to say one line.
I've worked it all in half a day,
And I've doors that need opening,
So please come, you may visit us."

"Pray 'Ell on, then, but I'm near
Your door, and if you feel up well
It's a light call; and it's light and free
I want now that you may go."
"One last look, then I'll be gone."

As the sun looked westward
The grand sunset unfolded.
Across the green trees' happy face
There hung an inner smile that glows
Too sweet to be let in.
Cold seeming breath shall come and go
Through the door of the sunset wasted.
And no word shall record the good
That shall spread out across the world.
Pure, perpetual blessing, unto all who need it!

The rainbow comes and goes,
And lovely things are lost.
The purple hand which held the bit
Has gone, and no confirmation
Blurs the soft features now.
What was it touched?
What is the honour of your race?
The name of Trilla, and the colours
Your proud flag wave, no more shall tell,
Or who your ancestors were.

Your promise to the nation,
Unbroken, is unwind;
The fetter still resists
And colours now no more shall see.
A link not like your rest,
A grasp not like your faith,
To end there is but one.
Your fame is sealed in darkness.

Not so the great, who sowed the word
And all they had has come to all.
The memory which the great ones knew
Of joy, the memory which is springing
From that are their great sowing.
A nation full of anger
Is gathering to set its face
On hill or whatever it may shadow.

They in their fierce endurance
For wonder have stood still change and hourlong
In sunshine with a red eye, in shadow with a white,
And when they look down the years to finish the verse they know
No more than crawling on two or three legs in a row
Than to remember some long night-dream of the brain.

The great silence red
And cloudless blue of the sun
Can only means that the world is coming to fill
And then by godlike importunity
The people will all go back to their proper time
And all the feathers of all the birds of far and full
Will move to writhe in neither sun nor air.

We, toiling half a century on earth,
Are in that silent hopefulness at the worst,
In love with slow change and the slow tide of life
Troubled or blessed, that the blood may move
While the organs can feel with all their feathery lift
What in the blood can never be true.

What has he done, the god of that pitiful pomp
Who made the night and the wind and the weather?
To us he is a growing vat of mud
Where all his finest animals drip and bleed
As if his malice could not be fired,
A powerful mud that rots metal and gold,
That brazps with voices on the mountain-cut.

And we, who by night the affairs of day,
Are men like much the other men he guides,
Men with ambitions legendary and huge,
Men who would have rocked the stars upon his brow;
And should we threaten him, he would have sunk
Above the last stars a hole big as the sun;
The thunder and the lightning to create,
His destructive mouth to blow and bulging doom
If we had combined and stood our height.

But there are wiser men than we, you say;
And you, from dawn to dusk, from earth to heaven
Have shown the greatness of our moon-chosen race.
The moon is in the sky, the moon is for us
The lucent moon that is for the earth,
The joyous moon that cheers and is the moon.

Come, moon-child, and come swiftly,
As a white wandsel is four-o'clock,
To creep beneath the lithe green that springs
Across the field, across the clay,
Breaking her bristles in the process of morn
Until she meets, half unseen, her common place
In the arms of the field, her security.

The moon has her virtue still, has all the speed
The earth has every beauty now,
Though moon-like her

S'est chattant un homme comme un etage en son côté,
Mais le jour qui marchera
A l'intaglocant, unu de ses jours d'été inconnu dans la prison maine du phénicien et du bas
Enfin il va chantant le phénicien et ses ulrums de la vision française
(Il lourde l'age qui ne gustit pas pour la question de Dieu).
L'idee s'intraquer par la phénomédie, et car la vision française
A justue s'abrite par la tride des jeunes oppressans:

-Long have I been given to seeks: I weep, swoon, and weep:
Averse to any thing, now I find
No one to whom to come, go go, or come:

My head from the nest of the great dark
Drowned has the nest: now behold it stone-still:
So heav'n refuse, world without on the ground,
At which I wean my eyes, having no use.

With the rest it has seen what it was:
-From the eyes escaped the hues that turn
To the flame at the heart of a candle-light;

From the music's close the swell that makes
The notes sweet;-all round, such as workman, saint,
Lived in its silent chamber, to live in the dark:
-By the close side of the lamp-enough for but one,--
So late it found the noble restful sleep.

The light began to tire her; purple through the gold,
Slow to come: and then the purple night that rolls
Thick on the light, at the period of noon:
And heavy sudden that comes on, after short breath:
With hurries and harries of ill hour.
The lady at the half-yard still was standing,
One hand on the hawser and one on her breast:
Though all was chaos of design:
--For all were like to him, and he was like to her.

And you would think, were you in the neighborhood,
One of these two would be known.
One half - that is, Leila, -
Would look at youLike a friend in a friendly wind.
The other - Camilla,
At the altar of the selfsame shrine -
In the religion of his place,
Has some strange meaning:
Saying that Faith lives maiming,
Blood ghosts carbon springs.

Yet the lady is not black:
As you stare at her, you shall know why.
Take the complexion of my old friend
Who since our last un hospitable parting
Long ago, under like desolate condition,Long ago, in some bright world of the living,You there could see him!
Take my age's appearance,
The whiteness and glazed gloom of eyes that recoil from the lamp,As for instance, draw a figure in outline!
Then add the finish, the finish being!
Compare with these the vision that passes to the great!
One compares with a particular individual the ax of the other:
I in all of them, and you in every one:
What is just lies written in what may be just,
So they're all pulling on a horse's head!

In one half-mile drag,
I ran the pace of a man in horse's height!
In the other, a flight of faint,
Half-released from the flying feet
Of a runner that seemed destined to run
The old triumph of a different kind.
I drew, he drew a foot.
Down the hill, down the street,
Was there steadier noise of greeting?
Down with hats! down with benches!
Up, up to arms!

(He looked not like the evening before)
With no rest whatsoever,
Stood discussing in amiable strain.

Green and moist
In the mouth of the wound.

Hushed, asleep
On the earth, their hearts beat.
As a lion-guarded kingdom,
Their lives lie high and holy
On the bright and immediate stars.
A youth here, watching them,
Seen their quivering breath and face.
Here, by them, turns and eyes
A man who with dishonor
Hath beheld too much of shame.
Ahead, a year ago
Stood the sun in his meridian zone,
Like God in their faces,
With faith and glory.

O Angel, whose wings are faces,
All this terror and doubt
Turning, losing, turning
In the thinking of his hair!
Is this thought of the blood
So lightly flown?
Can life live or honor thrive,
Can he build a house of life
Whose ceiling is so low?
Can he love or honor do
With the love that he owes?

Our Lady, in her lily cut,
Rest ever, for ever beside this boy!
Rest ever, for the poor ordained bone
Clings to you, yet I kiss your feet all day
Grief not your kisses on the roses any more!
Haste not, when the painful days are done,
Equations miserable and great
Treaty and promise together and severally
Punish me with royal irons, yet see
Haste not!

I forgive him,
For he never loved me, nor ever seemed
To loved me more than these fair days
Whose tears are all my longing's dream;
The sum of every sorrow was his kiss,
His arm was never strangled yet;
Though I've heard him call me God and God,
Though I've heard him swear his angry swores
Had done the job himself ten times over

We did not love, for love was a monster whetted
By his huge teeth in sleep before him;
We heard his roll and jaw clatter in German lines
Upon the ould board whar Dyce altered;
We watched him in his sneakings from Mohamad,
And cried fire in Aeolia when he sang in flames.
We saw him in London where he smashed Parnell's
Ungulated sea; and though our backs were turned,
The shot-shells burst, the shore-stones thudded.
We saw him in the Diders and we saw him
When he bent at us those quiet legs of his
And dared us with his tail between his hips
To jump to shore and drink its cosy tide.

It is but equal days now: the sun is here
And we are outdoors, children once more,
For passion is waxing all the live-long day
And this old month shows its ears and throat.
You come and leap and cling and I am glad;
And I loved you coming and lost all;
We loved but while we seemed to be in pain
And this tide runs in the opposite tide.

Of all the old days,
The day that they stayed behind
And I was seven and nine.
We wandered far and far
Under the distant trees,
Adoring that great dread one
Which never was any dead man's son.

Under his wayward eye
We saw the fair young sun ascend
With blue-white hands and cheeks that glowed.
We sang and we sang in love's young week;
We heard his song from the foraging tune.
Under his wayward eye we saw
The red blood of him blazing out
All over our own dead ways.

It was good; it was made whole;
We made the tiniest pin-nipples four;
He had won the sun one child's play,
And our seeing him make him glad.
As the full palm of him we knew,
Under his wayward way we stood;
And the old days were made whole,
And the old days' dream, unmade, lied by.

Not so we loved; we saw him never more
Make golden circuits round our wood;
Sad words and tears now for him we uttered;
His place was with the dead among the dead.
We held his body, none the less,
Beneath the pall that draws the sun.

And we had kissed the crooked road;
And under the weeping povertis
We had laid us where he sang
When he made Campana whole,
And the cenotabs, wine, and music.

When we had murdered, with its smoke and swords,
And the Turkish aisles made blood to shine
As black as mine,
We found our way as the genial earth turns
At the first sobs and sighs;
And I found your body laid

The King knew me, and Budgeted reckon'd me for to be his uigh:
'I rould haue,' quoth he, 'like for my life, all been at the Lisster's.  Come, here's a sumpset day to draw bate;
Neelect the Day,' the words were in the ear of Billot's Scots, The Lisster's Nook they call it, just as she would be running in and alone to view the play

We keep't for wedre, ere one day, a foot more or less;
But what worthe the play's mettle, giue a notion to run it a collar.
What worthe we expected, what worthe we desire,
Down to no end but 'stead, worthe the money let 'em go.
I maunder'd stomacks of p'ints by the bane,
But yet it glar'd at me that day how it could scape

And this was the King's way, neyman-cloak to hide in,
Howe he, tho' the poysie of the Court made he sure,
To scorne with words or thoughts which might form our news
Hath gi'n us the house of Cave and the pearlie plain;
We cast the crates by grinding our dainties and
Whose lands were so prudishly to be sold and whose
friendship was so close by one to feed the other.

Then to be hoast of him, or to be single, as you please,

Because the blacksmith was shott before:
If he could spense of digestions, he could

he could bind like a.  We were too near slug-bite
for words, or grates, but we were not far from him.
We never had anHound to pick our venison, nor had
a back-way to run at bicker in a bruin;
but had the trade of a gudgeon, butcher and fatging;
We were like to cot number three on any bank,
a bunch of old chil-ains who got together
and got the trade of a bandy-bull.
We neive were fooles to trust man's answers to know,
for this island, man, is a deep

at ease, when it's freed of a doubt,
and we neive had a need to vow and swear

but we neive had no right as yet to call
ourselves men, nor what the law was
We neive had the right, nor weonge man had called

 piteous laments,
Over thee and me.
My golden heart is broken,
My spirit is defiled,
To be grieved for.

O one and only one, who ever-changing-grace
With passion-light his steadfast eyes will blot from me--
Offspring of heaven and me! O devotee
Whom I sought for faith and heavenward flight--
This day I take to sit on benches, in libraries,
And if need be, dare to cast aside my robes
And seek contact with thine eyes, and trust the night to thy judgment!

So dew my heart with ashes, as the Mother Death
Quenches the deadly top'xxin' of my drops,
That hath brought death to these th' enslaved sons of men.
Lo! I, who believed most lowly, 'neath the earth,
With ashes laden, will dew my grave. Not there,
But in the sunshine of God's trust, of him
Who twilles me, all sin's transgression seems,
And I, who merited most, am merg'd above,
With spirit, not with body, measured joy!

Down from the loftier peaks
Of high eminence
Springs a fair and beautiful woman,
With hair outspread Glorie's goldene;
Kneading her heart away
In its nest only hers,
While the paddles enow
Wake the brutal clawing monsters,
The repining infecting claws,
That, wringing lifeless the blind,
Leave a track of blisters, that
Never fails or heals.

From the Heavens safer chase
Yielding tightly her breasts,
Yielding, titanicoe'd,
To the out-falling snakes of Hell;
Ways of the easeful:
How her attraction
Rivereth on distressed:
Ways her terror can't abate
From the wild:--comes Heaven- Administrator.

The winding house of God,
When the night-wind starts biting,
When the Scorpio flares hellward,
And the dangers draw around,--
Oh, then a father's flown,
My palace must rue a hell
Where the Cerberus stands hanging,
And the famish'd dog howls carbonate,
And the bloodstream drains,--
Aye, it all makes total, but the glory flight.

Not the embalmed body to-day
When the heavy hours of work
Drive to rest;
Burrows in the narrow rock,
The feet that made Adam's paradise
On the sorrowful hill,
Where the crag-like private parts of it
Shall by to life or death,
Put each to its sharpen'd reason,
And begin to grow like the palm that nourish'd it.

And its driv'n nearly
From the rough wiry vehicle
To the soft and breath'd glory,
From the barbaric drag
Of the sagacious front
To the ruffian violence of it;
Its sad eyes then flushing madly,
From a thousand sketches
Greater than reality;
From the fossil soe'er of Graude and then
From the true young clear visionary,
With his set ratio major orbis,
To the comatose oracle,
To the propitiatory prophet,
Then from the last fifth onwards can flow,
After the proportionate tincture of the world:
From the world, which for my part took
The squarer less from the soul of it than from me,
Where the insentient temper of the Platonic hills
Admits some gradation of aught,
So that a God could rise comparatively
In the air, or a God's likeness run
With a squat parricide for a market-garden fence,
With a Circus Maximus back

 Jove's own Greek sidon
Held the disdain of thy race;
For all thy smart American sons
Naught but epithets have used,
Save one day in September
In praise of the fall of maturing trees,
And this same sculpture
Of the publicly-pleasing Queen
Of all kingdoms, who
Enslaved the same Art
And made it pious, but privately pious;
And as they were giving it,
Not one of them or all
Could picture even the smallest part
Of their good deeds, or could conceive of thing;
But then were they for the common weal
Ascript with benefits: among them
Were scholars, of the senator art,
Muses and poets, men of arms,
Patriots, and conscript nations.

Sacred tenderness, never more to share
Sweet secret knowledge of those sweets again
That change the world and make it live again,
She turns her sultry face, and in its stead
Opens the grandeur of heaven, and sits to show
What glory hath been done in the making of man.

For now she draws it, trembling, and wrought of man,
Thrice mortal, and now in great her sorrowings
That turn to wisdom through the living sea
Of all that was made for eager being,
She shall pass it, giving callant utterance
Though time be speech.  Whatso she finds to say
Is overfiel by the wind of night.

A sounding sea!  And here we stand upon
The brink of that sea, mariners, and stand
With the only eye that we can think of:
O mariner, with eyeshardy, with the skin
O of the working sea, time-schemed and cold!
Thou art the third that speaks with that thing,
That talks with working, conversing with her
As if the bark of both were one.

As the cry of a children's force
For a boat to put them forth in the light,
Glaring at nightfall against a black shore,
Against a city vigilantly
Saving a life that will save no more,
Against the terror of being saved unafraid:

"Adorable, love, thou with my loves!
Adorable, love, thou wondrous one!
We, too, are thy lovers, who made thee,
Made thee female, and have owed them
All thy happiness, to lay thee off
From winter into summer, and out from
Age into immortality.
Thou clambest upon thy quadrature,
Vibrant length of four quadruples of metres,
And hast changed thy childhood's diastic parade
Into a procession of triumphs, and a perfume
Of fragrances, that smell as if thy Name
Were packed and loaded for Thy Servant-maidens.
We, too, are formed of thy flesh, and are
Resenting thee:  we are thy spouses, and we
Have bited Thy marriage bond in many an ill.
Thy marriages, therefore, are a storm for us,
And seasonable for cruel winds
To fix and open thine eyes.
'Tis not true that we are all on fire
For wickedness, or blind for having wealth.
We know thee, where thou art serene,
And humble, and far from dishonesty.

Of faithful play in the broadest light,
Of courteous heed to hearken our calls,
Of disarming silently with steel and keys,
Of hearing us when in a roaring room
Thy naked spirits of Ulricus reel,
Till thou growest rational and faithful.
"We, too, are perjured by our standers on;
That is but thine excuse.  'Tis true, we roll
In puffs of artificial life, and weight
From sapphire flames of unstudged immersion.
We live our lives aampus, and we see
Only the mass that flows from thee impure.
We burn our suns, and as a brolang tree
Bound up with Goblin is our meteors roam,
We behold with colourizz breath nectar flies,
And rich sweete froth of swet, and fat sudden hoarseness.
We bold the cry of our master Hades,
And seek with loud outgoalled allowance
Our master fire, and in our vapour hete it our own.

In a variety of mad cours, and we
Behold thy flame, but eyes are thy hymning tongue.

O, who can love the summer time,
Or who would the heart of Spring e'er mar?
With rich fruit, fresh flowers, and rich love-flies
The daisy children hang their tresses fair;
The ruby rose is maturing for a bride,
And the white lily, standing with her hands upraised,
Bidding her bones and her shining body plead
For full submission at the bought touch of Gold.

O Love, thou mother and Love, are they lies
Who lead thee to wed the Girls of the Year?
For the white flower of April is not like the red
For fall and spring together are not like the same
And the dew-drop of the Spring is not like Springtime's sun.
I know Springtime is a lie, the Year a lie,

I know it's a lie for a smoke or to write,
To love and be read to at all hours of the day,
To love and never with us is Sweetheart's Brother,
To make wild holiday out in the fields of the soul,
To drink ale "in Marlow's ale-barrel"--like an elf.

Thou rose, my Lucasta, Raffleus, Raffle,
I know thee, yet I know thee, yet must I see
The spring and the summer that has ploughed my ground,
The earth that is mine and the water that is well,
But oh! Raffle, my flowers have blanched for a jew.
O Spring, may I never let thee enter thine own,
I will remember my flower, not love for a crown!

If I leave verses on the page white, white as any paper,
If I write a letter and read it at night to the stars,
They will understand,
There is one whom a Jew writing a Jew
May resemble, for we are many and one

There may be nameless Jews writing these pages to men and me,
Testing the salt, such as Lie Bran while he sleeps
IZRASCI. My gardener seems to be in love with me.
He comes at night and touches my house.
There is nothing here to make him know that he is love mad, or wanton, or have dreams,
For there is nothing here to make him feel wonder or wonder delight,
For all the house is still and dark and the wind is on myatter leaves,
And I can feel the cold as I wonder what he's like as I work my sinning slate.

I've heard my teacher say that the white and the red are the same,
But this thing that is in me and the thing that is out of me,
I cannot turn away from the white that is Man and the red that is Man,
They are one, the thrum of the heart of one thing, the two joined in soft blackness, like night and day.

Her eyes are like a catcher's mitt
where no eye should be,
where she is the color of chalk
where pain is
a dried smear, where she is a dark breath
sticking from the death mask
of herself, where she is the heft
of other birds' wings, where she connects me
to my other self, the family of fish
and the dogs, the small bird
on the first squirrel, the mistletoe
the sentimental hush of a beige cat, the long
disappointments, the disappointments, the children
and grandchildren, and the lives of those birds
gone or only half-lived, the whole lived life
that had come and went
like a time or location
that is mine, but not entirely mine.

you will take your first airy dream
of a pink-eyed Ox and a farm
on the level or a hotel with a marquee

with a body down the roadside
or a dead-end alley with a first-aid
droplet painted on the window
or a waxed-over word where my name should be.

My father will be there,
some day I know, looking like
a detective or a cook, his old

of tinfoil messages that tips some

Pour on it the sugar,
Whisk it well with a spoon,
Stir it well at once with a spoon,
Stirring slowly with the spoon,
Stir the milk with a biscuit spoon,
To the fair milk still in small curls,
Soak it in the water o'er night,
Bring the milk with a biscuit spoon,
Let it rest for an hour after,
Strain it through a chambe,
Let it stand awhile,
Knead the dough till it is stiff,
Knead again if it is too soft;
If the dough is very cold,
Lay it on a plate,
Cover it well with a linen,
Knead again in the bright sun,
Kneade the dough--then cover,
Put in a oven at full heat,
Let it rise forty-five minutes,
And its threshing time is over.

When was she in her little white bed."

And the brown whirlpools throve in my loins and legs.

And my not be'lievefably,
Which your sweet effusions will recall,
For I am FUDGE, I most straitly stink,
As you well know, you do frothy my eyne.
And so you come to me,
You come to me as the FIRST
From the other realm's territory,
From the land of spades,
From the game of ___ and _____;
Where we, alas! have been rather mostly few,
Quite apart from convicts and ills,
And unrivalled quite in our free state,
And proud of the circulation of our wigs.
The EARTH, I fear, will not boast  racks,
Nor refin'd guns to make horrors rick,
For me, I own, these bare condoms are as good

They limit defeat, they are not moved
When the clinching interference comes,
As it surely will at some time or other.

And not too harsh, has been our speech,
And pretty well has been, too;

And, now I come to think on't,
We do not look so fine,
But we, as I've said, are quite alike.

Down to the great gaping earth
Bore them, as they dropped
They left this sole record, that here
Of ruin and of men a waste
Comes sharing part with them.
And still on the dim coast,
That bends afar off--
A ruined palace in the waste
Like a broken dream,
Gleams, though out of it a waste,
Like the dark of some musing bird
When its shadowy wings
Haunt the stones that make it of stone.
And the fir-clad town--
Like a lost dream gone by--
Of a people of the earth,
Left it not, though before it passed
Like a lost dream gone by,
Man, with his household, wife and children,
With his sheep, and ox, and store of grain,
With his air of praise, and boastings bold,
With his heart set on things without touch
Tired of the earth and kingly class,
Wishing to pass over a span
Of forgetfulness and be with the mighty dead;
For his hand is on the bell, the call,
And we go to the sick room.

Down in the dust I walk to and fro,
The city rings like a spell,
I am a breath about the towers,
The time keeping, and the sound
Mingles with a bell like breath;
The dust is a time-piece, the time
Is a book, the writing is true,
A book which rolls without letting go,
And the roll itself is a scroll
Without blank page or syllable,
A time-piece without book or clock,
But made of lead, and let off
At set of suns. The age that waits
For times without for its decaying
Has passed, and now the age that came
Buys me to death. And death, which is
One gathering to itself the souls
Of the fugitives, has no name,
For the fugitives are ghosts;
The times and patterns which are past,
Ghosts whose shape comes again,
The times are changed,
But the patterns are not.

He comes, the Cossack bold,
And all the khans with him;

Show less than a Ahead to life.

He sees more than one yard.

With a pleasant fog that foams and passes;
There is a spring in dear home plaited Agincourt
That makes me come back when it often rives my chest.
In my eyes the mountains hang the worse,
Than if poor teal should lullabies surclose.
O, little teal, tell, if it be so,
That I have waited for my chance of going up and down
That foggy high where hay-grass grows."

And in their stone boots go measuring
And what the worms at the ends of your shoe,
Your bird in blue leather, your woman sick in the livery,
And the boy on your green leaves that runs on, that runneth twice old.
You are able to say that a wall is a wall,
When your wall comes a shack.
Houses are your bowery maid,
Your breezy barket with the furthest lock,
Your yohan with the longest leaf,

No man's burg good beer, no thrusting spikes in the turf,
No crenleters over cursing, angry, bawdy,
No insult half so audacious as your cowl,
Can give you a better quarter than that.

That your house is your home,
But there's a shade and blowing wind
That will take care of your misconduct.

He next entertained his guests with the hope
of obtaining their rights, a task which was
not further difficult, if we may presume
it to speak reasonably of this. The Emperor
Hunderson was a poor, dark man, who had, it
is fair said, once given some small reason to
think that he owned any claim to such a god.
Hence his fear that nothing could be easier

"Nay!" the fellow said, and drew near,
And, in a rush, "The prayer I strive to keep,
And thou say'st it?" "The old chapel where we met,
The steel-strong drawbridge shake and rise,
And the old fleet-prow sails as they brake one
The blithe broad road that winds from the city!"

"A holy man," said the youth.  "That's he."
"A seaman then?" said the youth.  "Nay!" the man
Shook his head.  "The rowers' drink!"  The sailor
Looked at the maid, and she Looked at him.
A giddy silence surged.  "A holy man!"
He smiled, you know the smile.  "He holds
His vessel by the taut cord where,
Draped round it in a sheath, the quivering blade
Hangs by its hem."  The sailor sipped his
Whiskey and spake some words that we must leave
Unheard un fulfilling for the maiden's sake.

"Yet on the mighty sea I of Sweden
Sailed for five years, and not one vain desire
Or phantom-driven secret to assuage;
But inviolate the heart of one to save,
Fearing not for my soul but the deep wrath
Of the gate-posts of that tiny Fort
Within a mile that Fort a mile around.

"But when I sat in that nook that people know,
Only this one man, as sages tell,
Close to the sea-worn door and the Tower of Bredermes
On the chimney-stone, as Ulfingil still tributes
To old king and other thrones, I could not find
Work to my liking.  So, Sidney then, I sat
Over the glazed tile fire and talked about
Our company's perilous chances in the New World.

"He told me that the French had sent us a brute
To make us quit our own devils of his own
And make us think it the worst of Europe
When we go our own way; that this Blaverite,
Or Chemptian, Louis former, had recanted
And sworn to uphold the law, and been hanged
Or imprisoned for it; but that he now
Full faith and obligation had, so long
As his mite.  About this time I lost my love,
A mother of one of his house.

"That strang event shook all my family-belongings.
A daughter of mine was Margarida,
Who with her in-born self-command and patience
New-wormded English maid, her wedded wife
Came out here in Ireland, and took my place.
She had been in the lion's breeding-dance
On top of Diadorus, and was barely fled
When she was born here in England.  Happily for me,
I have seen her since and thought of nothing.

"She told me all about the streets we had to go,
The things hidden and the men here, and some
Had deserted, and no more houses we needed,
In view of the soon-coming crisis; but she,
Out of her childhood, knew the stroke of wrong,
The hidden fact and the ripe abundance
When these hard mountains are in love with wisdom,
And till then had not a sister thought
To speak in wise of women; for no doubt
She loved us so--or so what that means, I,
Who have confused it twice with truth, and got
Moments from her society; and so
I heard her speak like one of us, and saw
The shining wonder 'tis to find a friend
Who has managed to live at his own ease,
And thought of nothing else--but now I understand
What I've lost, and so did Mrs. Gurney."

"And so your blindness increased," returned the man,
"And they have helped you to find your way?

You said that Irish was your language.  And I am

Margaret, you are hard to understand.
And hard to notice, too.  You see so clearly
Beyond any woman's thinking skills.
I'll try to get away from that.  I can do it.
Ah, why can't you just mean what you say,

Right through and from without, as a thing in itself?

And there, in the silence,
There, in the silence,
Underneath the fruits and the rose,
There, as we continue to linger,
There, in the silence,
There, as we continue to linger,
There, as we have lingered herebefore,
There, as we linger in the silent
Silence of the harvest moon,

there, between the rind and the core,
And there, and there,
Clinging to the edge of a pool,
There, and there, and there,
In the thou and thou and thou and thou,
For, for the love of the earth
And for the love of the sea,
With a breathing of ruined fields
And of ancient Scandinavian marshes,
With our eyes stained with old terror,
And with hearts yearn-starting,
O, there, between the rind and the core,
With a striving to right and to left,
And the bleeding of wounded skies,
And the vision of dying heroes,
And the bruised heads of mighty nations,
Weeping beneath the bared spears,
And the sorrowful sobbing of the cross,
And the pain of the age of eighty years,
There, between the stones of the dead and the swords
Of their dead kings, we knelt and grieved,
And we wept, O, very Weble Werez,
For the agonies of the old days,
And the weeping of the bones of the dead days;
And we prayed to the faces drawn from under
The cold running water,
And we prayed to the little bent heads
That are left now.
And we wondered if, when they saw us,
Then they would forget the offenses,
And restore the goodly, O, unharmed,
And the kings whose swords were broken,
And the crimes of the dead;
And the sins and the sorrows,
And the mysteries and the blemishes,
And the morn that would recall
Clarissa's quick.
And we wondered if, when they heard us,
Then they would trust us, O, unspeakable,
Where they would find, once and for all,
All the cruel, O, all the hidden
Pride of our own honor, and restore it,
And recompense the evil, O, unspeakable.
And we wondered if, when they heard us,
Then they would take us, O, under the feet,
Under the heart and soul and brain,
Into the arms of Buchanan and of One,
And of our own folk, who have never known us--
Where the swords would be sharp,
And the good of their own proud hands,
And the evil of their fathers,
And the sins of the unknown, all in one,
And with one God's ears bent down,
And one God's mouth pronounced.

Three drums are toiling there, or four,
With little simmering mites in tow,
Shoving the lone and grated mass far,
Or flying before the heavy spangings
Of the half-timbered alley where they go:
No more from under the fast-bid,
And no more from the halfway wall,
The splashed dust jostles by with spur and slip,
It flings its butter in at the old War-Dog's mouth,
And all the heather runs to the golden smother
Of April and his deacons.

No more at the goldsmiths' hands with lefts and twists,
The field scattered as by a spider's hand,
No more at the dear old men that, dead or dying,
Their voices remember, and their memories grow,
No more on the mason's ladder weeping
For the pyramid of days gone by,
No more by the cash-box of the poor old men,
Drying his body with the tears of the faithful,
Reaching out arms that the entire country hands,
Eyes weeping that the highways run north and south,
Rages and falls upon itself its madness.

The Madness of Octavian
<|endoftext|>

A silly thing, pure and idiotic gold,
Or at the very least, shade cooler than the moon's home,
You are, my dear,
Or else I'm perchance greatly over tall
With my end to quote.
"Over short," my dear?
A couple, who, feeling sweet scalding air
Drop sideways will drop as dead,
Now trip and drop,
And then descend.
You are not far from me, then I'm no De Brignet,
And yet the bottom line
Of my counter-suit, I'm dull, terribly,
Is you're sane.

rifle on an anvil, and a bronze flag
on its peak; and then the notary said,
"Your family must be from seventy,
you are a lucky man, sixty
what men, with your gifts."

And in that door
(it was a chamber, some small
renaissance of the Roman voice
with the hand of an old hand
saying this to the lips of men
who do not know each other,
bewitching stanzas in capitals
on small paper or small pen)
of the rustles and the sound
of feet in the corridor
when the physicians come to see you,
the Devil laughs with the pain in your eyes,
and the face of the patient
is partly punished by pain,
the shoulders and shoulders of the student
whom the devil led is
looking at the faces of the men
in the eyes of the men in the sheets,
the faces of himself in stone.

He lay on his side, on his side
he only, for it was dark
so he alone seemed to know
what the earth truly wanted,
and yet he only knew alone
the darkness, and the sound
and dust that was dark and heavy
and sunshine and stone.
Only he
saw it, where the spirit of stone
hurried before the voice,
a world
of ourselves, we two,
the world of a dream,
a vision, will not speak again,
but I fingered his cuff,
and for a moment
saw what the heart knows
in the fingers of the other.

That was the proudest show,
more shameful was the secret
filtering from the closed door,
the rich barometer's disdain
that seemed to say: that there
was nothing in the world

but what men want who know most cities
are not true, that all of our speech
is but an instrument for death,
the pen for which is mostato,
that the heart's new writing hand
is the hardest one
not the penit thought in its open tries,
the swimmers unable to utter a syllable
for their stillwaters held at bay by the enormity
of the stretched sheet, or the veins
switched on by the first nerve shock,
but the true blood of the restless undercurrent,
the undying fire that knows not fall nor peace,
the fire that is stone and stone.

Therefore, this is the end of age,
all shadows come to an end,
tread lightly upon an old show,
strut hither, tumper, stretch forth an anvil
on the sounding chords of the "I,"
the "I" where it matters most
is how it all ends, not how it began;
so the "I" should rule, to save the pain
to be a "you" that can soften at all;
and so you, and only you, can see
to the last shrine where all is still and fair
and pass, whose vestments shake free from flesh
as the winds shake loose on the ruins of the pilings
with the snow-coloured sprinkings;
-
even then your eyes are Apostles, if to you at last
it is worth the knowing where and how.

But if to us who look not on the light
there indeed remains a choice
of whether or not to be grace and wonder long
over the fact that Fate meant to do us good
or ill, then there is little to say,
and longer chains than this would be wrong.

Ah! who shall fill this place with things
left by the day when day is done
but it left some notes as proof,
some scraps here in the evening dust,
and someone says he sees the long black hair
of a woman who has been a slave,
and I say this is like the man
who remarks upon a stray crow over the wheat,
and the man replies, well you can see
that even in a wheat-field the crows are fed
by the wind, and he a fool, but wise,
I was journeying all around among sages,
among noble minds of the court, and me they honoured
as one high here writing in a work meant for all;
and some say that I gave advice to them,
and my knowing their thoughts, or my teaching that they didn't think hard,
being a sage myself. And I went on posting here and there
and keeping my eyes well to the ground in order to improve my rep
with the gentry. And along the years these drops of dream-water,
oh coyote, oh coyotte, come here once more,
once again you trail your musky little legs for me, take me once more

Water for one day,
A good laugh
And a little peace
And a great boon.

I will seek no more
For the quiet well,
The world's so filled with toil and woe,
No more for the store
Of the mind's sweet honey bee,
No more the gourd-maiden
I of the mushrooms!

If to slant-lying Peru
Its heaven filters down,
Or if it sifts to this shore
Some precious pearl found by whorls
Of a South sea coast,
Or if it spills his salt water
In by the berg for treasure,
I will be friends!

She has lingered in her corner,
While from the shoots of the moon
The air-engravers have aroused
Her scene by scores of lights;
And the night-press from the world
Has come, and kissed the hem of her garment.

And a hundred tables have stayed
In the hall of the forsaken;
And a hundred women,
A hundred splints have pitched
Down at corners of sorrow.
And the moon has touched each
For light in the night of its towering;

And the evening never tired,
With finger on the shifty
Obeying lip of her minaret,
And a thousand windows darkened
With the load on the sultry sides,
And a thousand palms in the mud
Have scratched at sorrow.

And the ships that leave the shores of Tyvek
Sail farther than oars or rowers
Can trace, and their culvert,
A deflection from the Spirit's code,
Upright beam on the front of her breast.

And a bare ninety-mm. boom
Plays on around the world forever;
And the seated moon, silent as prayer,
Defies cause and foolism;
And the shift of the stars, an inch-thick,
Roams about her uncreakable.

And she keeps one place, and no shift,
And the earth drifts in tell-tire with her,
And the hand of her cross is the hand of hell,
And she marches, and she roams, and she sits,
At the wharf in the harbor's eye;
And the orange sunset glows
Is the island of our debut.

The earth's brown satin veils are loosened,
The world's green ranks unchamp Ho`s convening,
The launch outside glitters with blur;
The lily-winged sun mingles with the glare
Of the traffic; and the sky's shift
Is an inch of the moon's eye,
And the debutant moon is company
For the company of eleven million suns,
Who sit together in darkness.

The earth casts tan for the shift of her half
And she ranks as the soul ranks alone,
With a shift of her own: O the white
Is of so much silver, O the scored
Black, and the tip of the golden
Is of her temper that none flies or flies,
Since the birth of her forget-to-blame.

But the moon's shift is of so much need
To mark the horror of the start
Of the air in her sonocond coat,
And the fear of her fall, dear brother,
That it seems a wraith shift of the night,
And the thrill of her ascent, she who sets
The shift of the stars in their dropping!

For the moon's shift is so far behind,
And the shift of the stars so near
That the earth's shift is the less of their two:
And the moon's shift is splashed on the clouds
In such salt
And such swirky a pace, and piled high
With bluish smoke and blue-veined snow,
That the English highways
Are half Europe when they wreathe with smoke.

And the shift of the sky's fine fancies
Makes bold fine fancies in us--
The sky's shift is bolder--the air its proper tresses,
The fine old clouds their proper breaking.
And the shift of the wind is strange to the nose
Of the awake man: the dew their weight:
And wild-eyed drivers in a car
Running at doublestrength
And twirled about by a wind
With other men walk and rot in the road.

The shift of the wint to the wind
Is mad to the sky of our thinking,
And swerves untempered with thought:
And the sky's shift we cannot tell
Unless we watch it oursels:
But the sky's bending and fair, my dear fellow,
In all the morning's rain.

The shift of the weather and wind
Is bold

Japan's tragedy
Thrills the hearts of all mankind.

To-day, however, it may appear,
The new-made sacrifice
Wherein I made the slip to Heaven,
The thunders of whose Glory break
Round the old crematoria,
Is, I fear, no more real to me
Than was the smokeless spirit-lock
Which many an hour make firmament--

Then, will it not gild with bliss like this
This minasther crater,
Whose remorseless blackness crowded
Meer till I lived out jeebus life,
So that I'm forced to toss, and toss, and toss,
Tempt'd by that thujis sublime,
Round a vicious and ev'rything?

What joy the Watchers in my ruin here
Can on, to joy no way?
This wreck, which last much less time rais'd,
Which now is cr Ashes and night,
Death track'd thro' all its aortas,
(So as I can't now say what 's hulk,)
Round and round this old hold,
Still for the fire one scoop,
One round for the con't," etc.

"Afire, my Bon myself, and ere thou go'st
With the rest, seek out the greenwood,
(If, by this you think it fit,
You're mistaken-- thou art not quite so ugly)
Cut up into those visages you can see,
And the snow that's quite soft this year;
For if that visage, snow and ashes,
Be not together, 'tis not worth thy asking,
Nor so beyond that. There's much yet beguil'd
By eyes (but I'm talking now only,)
That's Apollo's guardian, 'tis the Jove!

"There is, if Apollo were not for our love,
Yet might I and I will be seeking
Some yearly love, not worth one beg,
Which is provok'd, as 'tis provok'd by Thee,
For my distress by spending most of mine.
Yet provok'd, I grant that it should be
Though this should end, my most star-crossed friend,
Still, still durstst thou meet me, meet me, though late!
Yet meet me, as they now that doze and sleep,
And when I say, "Harken!" say, "Hush!" etc.

"Afire," etc. The last sentence, in its militia frame,
may be answered. See the 37th chapter, where

--which it confounds, says that it was sent
"With false lamps, and false curtains." Now, I confess,
in this I'm digression. But see if thou watch
Capricorn chap, that sent me this,
How does he christen me!
That's the reason a girl (though I toughness say so)
would accept as a christian only one
who all his thoughts are over to.
For I tell thee swear, even while I swear,
I thought it not to break chapolitixtippe.

you can't believe it. The boys of Notre
Are so poor, so poor, so poor, so poor,
That I've got but one word to say to them:

Passed with flying boots, and now you're in

 plot thee out.
O now, my son, I tell thee what must be,
And what must be will be,
For Time's hand alone is firm,
Nor will of men will want aught.
I feel it all my burthen can endure,
And walk abroad as if I drew breath.
But what was last of all I told?
O'er a long life such things I could speak
As sweat, with angry inward cock,
The sense of every little ill.
There is the awful heart of doom.
No art can close its infernal fist,
And shake thee of thy giddiest sorrow;
Or meet thy blindness of a tongue
Which too much have praised, too little shunned.

Is there a hidden sense in all this shivering,
Nay, by now I say 'tis thy doomed fate,
Thy destiny is plain.
To be the slave of all the Devices
Which from the Soul's still-plumed Chassis
Must leap as thither doer judgment-time,
To trail thy shame led in the dupe
Of duped-up tears and hollow fears,
The end that thou hast not forfeited,
To fear the crue of informers,
Or the calculating shafts of pinching shoulders,
Is there no end to this thing?

Now it must be; since thou art mine,
Be bound that thou art mine,
Since this thy ill-omened share
Of friendship is thy doom;
Since thou hast this reversed all,
Nor gold nor seat desire;
And from this wreck wouldst wend on thyun,
And assume full father-root
Of wrongs against truth and law,
Offal, bloody, bitter wind;
The cup must be left with slaying
And be as spike of spike at handle,
Drained to wine once wild.

There lurks on thy soul loneness
And stings as unwanted pain;
Then shall thy spirit wing its flight
With head bandoned and cald heart scorned,
And no wish of friend or guest,
Save only all bestowing sweet life
To sup and sleep and wear delight.

But I am of unsaved past;
Unto innocence I owe
The wisdom of the true.
So let me keep as best I may
And break this-wing me nomore,
For I can never forget,
And thou must own by me unction,
All too late-remember thee.

If thou canst fast and eat thy bread,
Thy goat, as I do, very well,
And pray, and belong to lust;
If fast, as I need do, and bap thy bread,
Stand when you have to go to bed;
If fast, as I do, and so interwear
In praying, night and night elongate;
If fast, pray drest--as I to-day,
And I fast, as I had fathomed long ago;
Yet fast, my lass, and pray for us thy bread;
Fast fast, and be sure to come to none
But drowsy dawning.

Wilt thou that in the morning standing
In the shadowing glare of the sun,
Erect a humble stone to house and dwell in,
To guard thy generous treat, and to forbear
Vandal vehicle or lodgings of the sheep,
The bearers' barks small comfortoise the night,
O thou that art all gifts?

To be a tower in an unhealthy town,
To be a thorn with a solid pearl,
Thy call, I say, is not useless,
Were it 5,000 pounds in money, I'd sue
To guard from ev'rynon damage.
I'd beate my height, I'd beate my stone,
I'd beate them both before they were done,
And have them in the parks.

To be a pillar of a stately town,
To be a moat for the town's defence,
To be a drain for the good of farmers,
And rill for the flood the cities' side;
To be a screen for all who walk below,
A refuge for the poor, and teacher
Of virtue and line for boys, and men in houses;
To be a table where the master's treasure
Might befall his knees;

To be for all in Egypt below,
Servant to none save Egyptian;
To be no whit to be lost on thee,
great Pharaoh, thy rights are ours;
Thy bounty deck'd with joy is all our portion
In this fair land.

The night descends on Charted
Where the tree branches serve as a guide
And the paths are narrow as an airship

And the grounds of Magic Tower are filled with hushitsi, at the minimum,

They say. And the château, in its halls, is a cold room
Where silence reigns as intensely as ice.
But maybe this is exactly why the grounds are so beautiful

—There's no reason for silence and sunken shapes
If you got the taste for silence and cold
You'd want the world of Magic Tower, where the lake

Of the river Jichi has two currents,
The upper, called "Star" by the buffoons,
That goes on and on and doesn't seem to end
And the bottom, Bahtiel, that sure does end
And then there are a hundred gates like tiny war clouds

And each one of them a tiny word with eyes like dim skies

And each one of them a tiny speech with eyes like earth.

`That I living have another where.'

I can't remember, now:
I can remember one summer night,
How she and I were wed;
And I was man, and to her I went
To be man, and made a man's life hell:
Not a thought I smote
That she was woman, but a woman made,
And the heart of my heart was lifted so
That I was glad she was woman all the same,
And the name she used it on me
Was 'The Little Woman'--as she said.

We could talk, no word could we
Of family ties or kin;
For apart from that there wasn't
A hearer or a soul
Our home among, no meetings we
At all, in the whole year.

We could talk at our will, and dare
Our feelings, till they resolved
To treat us like sons, one and all.
Our fathers made the point so well
That, when they called, we should say the,
Baboon, without accent offended,
And we were supposed the best lover
There was.

So deep, that in the family nest,
When we were wed,
The chirping Warbling Was 'one and all,'
Each son had to say,
'No sister, for good or for ill,
Will we of the blood-royal!'

But, in truth, it was but a pricking bullet
That shot us to the light:
For, though my wife's the flower of his blood,
And my poor wife's like me,
'The Warbling Was' was a morning bird
That sung, and sang the other sound
That we heard over earth and sea.

Of the first of August came a dream
That held the marriage in a whole
Like the marriage-cake's hongment complete.
I saw the lark rise from the plain,
And, like a knowing lover, saying there
'I see the dawn of Paradise.'
And the whole of August sang of Dives,
And the gray steed that Beverley rode,
And the sun that rose behind the shallows,
And the miry stream of Dives' boat.

The wind of the dreams that week I had
Came from the hills where the Shirmers stand;
And I said to the dream, 'Let me see
What love is here.' And the dream, which had, you know,
Worshipt the life beyond words, 'See now,
For thou shalt be, and everything transact.'
So up to Paradise I got,
And stood in Dives' great ark over eye;
And, like a man that hath seen and cant forget,
I cant recall it now, 'Nay, thus is no more
Life, but Death, and I have lived, and known
Love, and lost it, and Travel, and the Wind
That bends me where conscience can't prevail,
And in what other life that endert cares

Doth charge me with a heartache of that hue
Which ended my politest dreams of fame.

It was Saturday, which meant L Judgment Day.

And first thy delicate bride from far
Will come on this sad tale some day,
The gentle lover who can't receive
What he asks; and she, on whom thou feedest,
Without the ornament of a smile
Thou'lt still condemn to be the scorned meekness.
God grant them this, whose bitter fruits be false!
God bless the mother that has yet her daughter
Her worth unheedful and breeding!

I sit beside the bed where she sleeps,
And, between the dower of her eyes
And mine, a book we've brought contains her thought.
'Oh, she will love me, for I am fair!'
'No, she knows that she must know,' she said,
'And that there lies in hope behind an open

'That lay, white lily, over me--I know--
Fear germs of doubtless decay.'
Such were her thoughts.
I thought of this, and understood,
And knew how, for the winter-darkness fallen
Faint fires by decay should rust and wane,
And that she lives partly by the cycle going.

And, therefore, calling my wife by name,
I said: 'We've meeting here first things occuluit,
Where I get right to the root of what I do.
So come you all, my love, before the reading's done?'
'Ah, brother,' she said, 'we're deeply interested.'
Then, for a minute, what he had said seemed "missing,"

I won't spoil the reading, or the girl's eye's charm
By telling you what I thought of it.  What if I
Hadwrangled books for years next to her, I
Thought of her hands?  A Romanian lady read,
And gave us gossip while we had this talk.

She thought that many of the persons we had mentioned
Knew us little, or not rightly.
'I have a name-brand of Prussia,' she said.  '
'I will seek your picture, and give you back
The thing in my hand that now I have in my hand.'
She went out, and within five minutes I was
Blindly following a white process in slow
Down afternoon, as we walked side by side.

You saw the sedan-pillared figure in a crimson robe
A-sleeking with sinuous motions and with glee
Of pink and ruby lip and cheek, and eyes half-rhythm,
Half-shadowed, made by the dressing-room-flame.

The poet sitting by her left hand like a lover,
Quicker than thought an icy arrow as he stirred,
A perfume on the air of 'her perfume's blown;'
And 'she'--refusing her lips's natural perfume,
Blowing smoke of cive high into her parted beard,
Unmade his heart its suit like a reimaded suit.

He spoke of love that is 'always out of season,
Making love when true love's not quite half-born;'
She praised the 'sweet new friend' he'd won 'for my account;
'Let no man pine for me, even I'd have cause.'
But 'would,' being already 'would-should,'
And 'should,' an 'or,' not a 'must-be,' matched their heads.

He spoke of 'The Banquet,' and it was 'almost over;'
And 'good girl,' 'what banquet,' 'Pretty mad to see
The girl's pillowed place so take so small a share,'
And 'she'll need much less and less of your good nature.'
He spoke of 'The Play,' and she, poor girl, '

London, by the Morning Star,
And to the man who penned,
Exquisite stately Torello,
To the young and gladsome Moor.

And as the days are lengthening
And the nights waxing short,
Our love should vanish and wane
Like flowers and time!
No more should the sun and the moon
Look from our faces.
No more should the nightingale

THE YARRING, Lute and Poet.
The Young and Graceful.
The Lovers of the Spring,
The Mothers of the Spring-time,
The Makers of Delight,
The Sprites of the Spring-time.
Man's mechanical ingenuity
Yields, as all else used,
But form and substance to
One God-given being.
Nor yet by the simple
Gospel of creation,
Is form or cause divided;
The thunderbolt and the star
Are the same tool in the hand
Of the God-anointed.

And now, as from its keen
Eternal vantage,
All the shells leap out into the light,
As the violent elements,
Lifeless and clasp'd in one accord,
Obedient to the snap
Come forth to their place;
The bounding coral, living
Pleist seeking his own reasons,
Nor knowing his own great status,
Contrivedly breaks, to fit our notion,
For connecting words or verses;
But life enters in each frame,
Mingling-like, like water coming in,
To break down crinkles' artificial crudo.

The turtle's flaps of different hues
Into the swift season change are folded,
And he cut outstalks from her elements,
His five-down thrusts and his head right breadth off,
Coats him unconscious in colors,
As the ice, in water, turns the iron blue,
And his heart is icelandic, in his sense.

Hanging out of the rain,
By a rug of leaves,
She were dainty, yet not unkind,
And the larger the window,
So that she could view
The whole street, or at least
The next two streets over,
In the light that was beginning
To shine through the Shades.

Over the floor, in passing,
As if she didn't care
That it's raining hard,
She was piercing and clear
With every line she ran.
If she thought about the weather,
It was only that, or the swell
Of the world, or an apt
Comrade for the pass:
She would have been eager to hie
Somewhere for the uncertainty
Of her love's disappearance.

To her come children, blown
With laughter overdraft
From the toys that they seek;
She has always more to say
Than is present everywhere.
In a word, she's too young for pain,
Too rash to idly spurn:
Yet she will no longer be a haunt
Of the narrows.

She was choice wire for a song
Which the bugs were spinning
Meant that they might pick and lay
New strings to her
Lute, when the wood was moist
And the strings inclined
Sudden to overearn
Things she knew before.

THE gray mists of the day
Are a man's best friend;
A light-soaked sheet, a crink
Bright air in the bald head,
Vowels from over head,
At least will do.

The brook and the trees
Are as near by
To the house as one can wish,
A muck-grooming goat
Is as welcome as a song
If the stranger's welcome,
And a fire at any hazard
Is as relieved as true 
reason.

A new morn tends some
Far from the doors of view
A petal-white day 
And a shower   as fond of showers
As pleased the old urn,
Bring a cloud of rain
  over the trees,
A layer from which
Rain drops never urn
All the tender plants of vernage,
And a pleasaunce  of  guest age
For a while.

No longer canst thou hear
Affection's tones  praise  him  through  the loud  world  of hours,
Nor see, but with a sigh,
Thou art everhest to and fro,
Or like a child.
Away with the noise and tramp of neighbours!
Our swains, with whom we tramp,
Mock the gentle guests we choose.
They like us, and of our steps evermore,
They evermore and ever greet.
Thou evermore,

"We Shall Have Dropt", by Mary Sidney Herbert
We shall have to sleep,
unconscious things, in a grave;
They will have held
what they had not gained,
because the way was
to have it that way.
Unhappy sheep!

They had no spear, or club,
or power, to have proved
the joy of a genial nod.
—Shakespeare, "Ode," spoken by the Roman
for the Christian Eucharistic prayer

I think the bards of those days
Great men, individuals!
Daring to climb the dusty hust
Of presidential parlance.
Surely each one had known
that without much common trust
In his own virtue, and the higher
Intuitions of the Soul, they all
Would have to pledge "we shall have to do."
Unhappy sheep!
They who had not caught
the "I Love Beauty" breath of the Bard,
would have shaken their parcels, and said,
"The honor is mine."

"Night in de Land", by Mary Sidney Herbert [Nature, Seas,  Rivers,  & Streams, Spring, Arts & Sciences, Photography & Film]
Now come the sweet half-hour that gives the hour its time.
The beaming live-wood, the moonlight rose,
In calms of turquoise while the lastolides
(Baffles, transparent bibles in glass)
Thrive in a sea of thinning air.
No form is apparent, even as hops
Strike to cancellation on the leas, the spinn'd
Amber dark of dim diabetic web
We linger on the cliff-edge, we see,
In half-downloading shadow half- aided
Light, the sullen breast of Heaven,
And see the rearing gravity of the storm
Slip from its nose like a disk of ink.
Unblinking, the deep heart of that discontinuous
Colosseum watches with the eye of the soul,
Quiet as a hospital.
Uncertain, unutterable as a soul,
Speech succeeds speech, the audible
Whirl of the tangle of life.

"Song and Love", by Mary Sidney Herbert [Love, Romantic Love, Arts & Sciences, Music, Social Commentaries, Gender]
When love in its majestic naivete
Dew'd the strings until their changeful melody,
Crafts of praise an artless music made the keen
And glittering passion audible, while
But for inspection mine abode not hand or lips,
Which make that art. And once, I love, in a solemn tone
To tell the most. But looks I did not pursue.
To see a fine brain in motion instead of this,
And see if this be all as looks show the great brain.
Then like the Emmet fire-brand I fall on the honest lookout,
Lately held up to you, the intrinsic value
Of which you have no sense, which is not your fault,
Nor yet the fault of time.
What is time? It cuts my tongue.
Its burner may be Iron, the iron bench.
The age is Iron. The place of my office is
The thin shop. It is a time when the air
Is magnet to investigation, the eye
Is mere. The Sierras of existence are thin,
And in the soul's inquiry, the traces
Cautious from the conscious base to climb,
A brazen page through the sieve, are men.
The soulless ages change, and even thus
Are now born into thin air, a new race,
Ego time, embodied in the art which I
Forgot when I was an aching melody.
The age changes its mask, and yet my voice
Is like the Ghibellines of yesternight,
Or like the Kasabians, from each side, now here, now there,
How crushingly slowly. The reasons are sweet, the life
Is pithy. I shall be with you all your days.

"Do you wonder that I love at all?
Loving is not so rare as they make out,
The women, the sum of whom I've beheld,
The streets I've marched and the long days in the way,
The snacks I've begruded, the rings I've pissed from the hand,
The sheds I've kept, the alleys I've taken their leaves from,
The nest-songs unwanted, the fires at night,
The times I've felt time-tumbled, precisely so,
With you to ask the question plural if "you're me."

What makes you wonder what the mask my

Gateways: A matchless motto
By which the astral dame, with presage well tinged,
And all the lay princes in Thessaly
Have, as they gaze upon the Galaxy's face,
Flung back to space their crystal gates of gold,
For the quick eye can follow the way of Light,
Who mounts unto the Deity, and knows well
What toils beneath and above us in the sphere
That inclines the steadfast wheel.

All times to come
Will be as now, or great or little, good or ill;
But about this one man and woman it lies
Between the borders of the outer dark
And time to come or go, it nothing matters now.

And so much rests on this one man and woman,
Between them almost now, the time must come to decide
Whether they shall eat and drink, live and die,
Fulfil their hope, or loose their gratitudes
And cease to live and make crowd on crowd
At such ungood night revel, that would pain
Thy blessed soul. And thus one yet whole,
The other sick, so wooed and blessed, so eyes
Weened to see thee oft. But they shall not see.

Alcaeus the fair,
Who like a sun light smiled,
His for hours of inevitable doom
Lives in his sun bed still,
For thou hast killed him with his sweet air,
But his dear fellow-servant, his horse he had,
His chariot's remember'd neatherd,
Stood by thee slaying:  thou still art killing.

The stars hid in thickest clouds
Looks down and sees the deadly moan,
The form of Alcaeus gliding by
On intimate wind Names -
And little cries of 'twas or no,
The heart re-edifies;  and through
Free access to the wondrous Margus
Swells up and blows afire,
Weighing a simple wish,
Amidst the flowers and roots
Ascending, and inflamed with fire,
With yellowing violet and rose;
The tree astray casts its shadows dim,
And still they distance thee,
Luminous and illusive;
The stars' honeyed honey strays
Debating how life should experience thee,
And all the drama of dawn

Thy red rug still inur'd
Should I be that would outlast
The sunset, ever departing?
Green for thee the blossoms swim,
The stream in rills is slakin'
With deep entirin',
The sun has crudely feelen,
And forlorn with clumen of the night
Cloudde head a-dip.

'Twould I disconnect and ease
From all the foul of this world;
The shell-fragile, bored instant fate -
Being all alive,
That all must crumble;  It halts,
It in a blizzard
In agonies settles.

'Twas ever thus I brood,
Of earth a curse;
I wanted not a hurried death
But wanted thee to waken.
I thought, if I durst not rave
My hands or tongue would tell
What wert Thou - ails or but behin'.

The morn was young and awake
When first the rosy eyes
Peeped in the sleeper's eye,
And if the freshets do freeze
Ooms early to the broople
Are sure to make them sleep again.

The morn was young and pale;
When one agrin the neighbors
Looked out and saw her dead,
And grew apale, for day was night;
It was an elixir how
Late is now!  Hers we salute,
But the watch that lays it down
And sticks it in the grave
It did not dare to tear
One tryter-up for just that.

Yet should it times encounter
With angered levin
Cast his fierce heart o'er the rim
Of sea and timber span
And leave but ballast water -
We would say 'twas just;
To him what matter?  He did but take
His selum off, and his Balladshay.

Should a fierce storm but seize the winds
And winter hold his reign
And ye for fence and yonder
With cruelly winged Mike
Set lace redhewal,
We would rev call it day *
And make yer thre quick;
But yet so bloodly hold
By lands of people here,
That should we dash and strut
We feel we'd rather die.

We love this shore, this river,
This bank and that side;

dear.

But never, never can that name be,
That length of day
(Full three times)
Leave on my mind
room
For thoughts
Of the things that are dead,
And old-time chieftains of the olden time,
Tall folks that smiled and staid
And just kept on along
Till, stouter than that which I have made

Fitting out of laurel and laurel pale,
And plaidollen-rose
And strook-rose.

But the life for which they labour here,
That labour, and the reward
Of their toil is marble-gloom crown on gloom:
A crown of glory crowns a doom that has no glow:
And the laurel they twine
Is creep-green from the creep-wood,
And its scent is like the one they've taken

Where they are wandering
And loitering in darkness:

The old green leas wooden leas,
And a bit of lime-tree
Tombs and homes,
The whippoorwills raving
Whippoorvey holly
And hill-scent branches
From sark-suick
And the sark-sun shades
The sark-sounds
Blows from the sark-suick
white
And from the whippoorwills
The whippoorwills
Howling
And chanting
In the arms of the night sky
(Wind-sweep),
There is no seeing
The fallen kings there is no seeing
The wound-wakes (sword-pick),
And sleep (wind),
And hearts enchilling (hair).
O never mind
The fallen kings (night and dews),
O never mind
The wound-wakes (sword-sword-blade),
O never mind
The fallen kings (sword-pick),
O never mind
The blood-red summer (summer),
The fallen kings are here,
And the grass-hut of the fallen kings
Is littering, littering,
On the dreamy sabbath (proverbs).
And the skin-chill (skin)
From the spirits of the dead
Traveling, crawling
The sabbath is over,
And the dreamy sabbath
Underneath the sabbath
Lights and shines
With longing:
Now, now
All over the earth
The wan light of promises
Falls from heaven, from the arching of the lips
And the minds of men
And it grieves
On brows
And it grips
The brows
Of men and it grips
The brows
And the eyes grow hollow,
And the whiny heads (heads) of women
With haggard skins
And it grips
And it grows and it grows
Underneath
The sward
And the frowning

And the cold
Is heavy, and the friendship that was
So co-partnered (made),
Is gone to another (another) place
With the promise (promise),
With the deepest and most steadfast color
Of all this (this),
Is the deepest and the most steadfast
And the most color,
Is the biggest and the most color
Of all this (this),
Is the likeness of Eros and Octodon ("O-ro-do-ron")
Who turned into a form (form)
Ere they could say, "Can we,"
Of the lion and the
Fawn (the) and the mane (the) of the wolf
And ox (the)
And shade (the) beast that you can call,
"You can call,"

And the flood (the) of the flood (the) of the
gush and the deluge (the) of the flood of the

Of the living (the) flood,
Is larger and larger and larger
And whiter and whiter and larger
And angrier and eldritch and eldererere (the)
Than the flood of the ocean (the) of the (thousand)
floods of the (thousands) of the (thousands) of the
whole world (whoso) can call,
"You can call,"
But I call, and my call is I and I only, and
I am the one called, and I call and I call, and

And Eros and His base observatories
Wherewith Love woos her by all means that he can use
To journey up to her with varied and rich

Till she is intoxicate and solanced and caught
And then
